People have been debating for a long time about whether Bitcoin is “just a fad.” We don’t claim to be economists nor mind-readers. But what we will say is that many analysts are missing an important factor: that Bitcoin is just part of a larger revolution that hopes to <em>completely liberate the internet</em>.</p>\n<p>What are we talking about? In one word: <strong><em>decentralization</em></strong>.</p>\n<h3>What is Decentralization?</h3>\n<p>By <em>decentralization, </em>we mean any situation in which the operation of a computer network is controlled not by a central authority, but by the community at large. Examples of decentralization are: Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, IPFS, and the BitTorrent protocol.</p>\n<p>The word <em>decentralized</em> is often confused with the word <em>distributed. A d</em>istributed system in one in which multiple computers share resources and computing power to accomplish a task. The key idea that separates <em>decentralized</em> from <em>distributed</em> is that decentralized systems are not controlled by a central authority (such as the owners of a server farm) and are instead <em>self-regulating. </em>Distributed systems can be centralized, but decentralized systems are always distributed.</p>\n<p><em>Decentralized</em> is also confused with the term <em>peer-to-peer</em>. <em>Peer-to-peer </em>(P2P)<em> </em>systems are distributed systems in which no node has more privilege than another. Networks usually must be peer-to-peer to be considered truly decentralized.</p>\n<p>Decentralized systems must contain a mechanism for determining the true state of the system, in case a malicious actor attempts to tamper with it. Bitcoin uses the blockchain data structure to achieve this; it is essentially a tamper-proof ledger and the persons who record transactions the quickest are assumed to know the true state of the system. The true state of the system can also be determined through voting and consensus.</p>\n<p>So why do we think decentralization is the future. In short, <strong>it gives power to the people!</strong></p>\n<h3>History of Decentralization</h3>\n<p>Before we go into the benefits of decentralization, it would be helpful to go over some examples.</p>\n<h4>The Early Days</h4>\n<p>In 1980, the decentralized discussion platform <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet\">Usenet</a> was launched. Users could read and post messages to categories known as newsgroups. These newsgroups were hosted on a variety of servers, usually owned by internet service providers (ISPs). Usenet is a direct precursor to the internet forums we know today.</p>\n<p>Many social apps (Mastodon, PeerTube, etc.) have been developed in a similar vein to Usenet, and together comprise an entire ecosystem of decentralized social apps known as the Fediverse.</p>\n<p>In 1999, the peer-to-peer music sharing platform Napster was released. Reaching its peak in 2001, it was faced with a number of lawsuits because it facilitated the sharing of pirated materials. In mid 2001, it was forced to shut down its entire network and has since been rebranded as a music store and a music streaming service.</p>\n<p>In 2001, the decentralized file sharing protocol known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent\">BitTorrent</a> was released. When a file is added to the BitTorrent network, it is split into pieces and distributed across multiple computers on the network. A client wanting to download the file would retrieve all of the pieces and reassemble them. Like Napster, BitTorrent is infamous as a platform for sharing pirated media, but continues to survive for this day.</p>\n<p>The difference is that unlike Napster, the BitTorrent protocol is entirely decentralized and cannot be shut down by a single authority. To destroy BitTorrent would be to ban all BitTorrent clients available on the web, of which there are many. Contrast this to Napster, which had a single, proprietary client. If Napster was not a for-profit and made its client open-source, perhaps it would exist today.</p>\n<h4>Bitcoin</h4>\n<p>In 2008, a person or group of people known only by the pen name Satoshi Nakamoto released the <a href=\"https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf\">original paper for Bitcoin</a>. In it they describe a digital currency in which transactions are recorded in a tamper-proof ledger known as a blockchain.</p>\n<p>Everyone on the network has a copy of the blockchain. Like we discussed earlier, the “correct” version of the ledger belongs to the user that can record and verify transactions the fastest. This process is called <em>mining. </em>Miners are rewarded in Bitcoin; this is how Bitcoin is introduced into the economy. Every 210,000, the reward for mining is cut in half, so there is technically a finite supply of Bitcoin.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin is what really pushed decentralization into the mainstream. There is an estimated <strong>200 million</strong> Bitcoin wallets in existence. As of writing this article, a single Bitcoin costs about $32,000. Special computer parts have been developed for the purpose of mining.</p>\n<h4>Ethereum</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/\">Ethereum</a> is the most popular cryptocurrency behind Bitcoin, but what it offers is much more than a digital currency.</p>\n<p>Going live in 2015, Ethereum introduced an innovation that elevated crypto to the realm of traditional finance: <em>smart contracts</em>. These contracts were self-executing code that, like normal transactions, were recorded on chain and thus were binding and tamper-proof.</p>\n<p>What Ethereum introduced was the ability express concepts like loans and interest in the form of its smart contracts, making it as powerful as traditional currency. All of the instruments of traditional finance could be reinvented, forming an ecosystem of DeFi (Decentralized Finance) applications. Smart contracts could also be used to write entire applications on chain, known as Dapps.</p>\n<p>Finally, Ethereum introduced Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), which are individual units of data stored on chain, used to certify the uniqueness of a digital asset (photos, music, video game items, etc.). NFT’s have most famously been used for selling original pieces of digital art. In 2020, a series of works by the artist Mike Winkelmann called “Everyday — The First 500 Days,” was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everydays:_the_First_5000_Days\">auctioned in the form of an NFT for <strong>69 million dollars</strong>.</a></p>\n<h4>Decentralized Storage (IPFS, Storj, FileCoin, etc.)</h4>\n<p>If you follow tech news, you’ve probably read about a government or mega-corporation whose records were leaked by hackers.</p>\n<p>Decentralized storage protocols provide a number of security benefits over traditional cloud storage providers. These protocols tend to encrypt, split up and distribute files in a similar manner to BitTorrent, so workstations hosting your files are unable to view them. They are also <strong>fault-tolerant</strong> in that a single compromised node does not bring down the entire system. Finally, these protocols store files <strong>redundantly</strong> such that lost data can be easily recovered.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ipfs.io/\">IPFS</a> is special in that it is not just a storage system but an entirely decentralized version of the web. IPFS is able to host web pages that can be accessed through your browser. IPFS already hosts search engines, messaging platforms, crypto wallets, databases, and more….</p>\n<h3>The Case for Decentralization</h3>\n<p>The beauty of decentralization is that means independence from Big Tech, governments and financial institutions. It means the ability to communicate and exchange assets without any middlemen. It means the ability to speak freely without fear of censorship.</p>\n<p>Let’s start with the issue of censorship. Consider a person living under a repressive regime who wants to speak out against the government. If he uses a state-approved social media app, his communications will be monitored and censored, and he will possibly face legal consequences. What if he uses a decentralized social app like <a href=\"https://joinmastodon.org/\">Mastodon</a>? His posts won’t be in the hands of the government, but in a server belonging to a gracious individual. What if the government finds who is operating the server and forces it to shut down? He can use a serverless, blockchain-based app instead of a federated one.</p>\n<p>The point is that decentralization makes the internet <em>un-censorable</em>. There are plenty of “alternative” social media apps (Parler, Gab, etc.) that claim to stand for free speech, but can they really be trusted if they aren’t decentralized? Keep in mind that it’s not just the social media company that controls what appears on the app; it’s also the server owner, the government, and the app store operator in the case of mobile apps. The iPhone version of <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/parler-returns-to-apple-app-store-with-new-hate-speech-censorship/ar-BB1gPCDT\">Parler now censors hate speech</a> so it can appear on Apple’s App Store, for example. (We are not condoning the use of hate speech. We are simply stating that no centralized app can be trusted to protect it, along with more benign speech.)</p>\n<p>This brings us to the biggest controversy surrounding decentralized networks: what is there to prevent illegal content from being uploaded? In the case of federated social media apps, the server owners are in charge of moderation, but what about serverless models like <a href=\"https://ipfs.io/\">IPFS</a>? The truth is that there is no easy answer. Consensus can be used to determine who is allowed to post, but if existing social media is anything to go by, “upvote” systems can be abused.</p>\n<p>While illegal content is a legitimate concern, we personally don’t see this as a reason to shun decentralization entirely. If worse comes to worst (keep in mind we’re talking about very new technology), the centralized and decentralized web will coexist in a similar fashion to the “surface” web and the “dark” web. But we don’t believe that this will happen. A more likely scenario is that server-based protocols will simply overtake serverless ones in popularity. Just like the “normal” web, there will be sanitized and un-sanitized places to accommodate all kinds of users.</p>\n<p>Let’s move onto cryptocurrency. Crypto has essentially ushered in a new economy free from the influence of banks and financial regulations. Middle-men have been completely cut out of the equation and the money supply is controlled by a fixed algorithm. The result is the pinnacle of free trade.</p>\n<p>Why is this a good thing? It lowers the barrier of entry into finance. It can be used to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/iran-uses-crypto-mining-lessen-impact-sanctions-study-finds-2021-05-21/\">bypass economic sanctions</a>. It offers an alternative currency for countries suffering inflation. There are lower transaction costs. A limited money supply means it can’t be devalued.</p>\n<p>Of course, there are many concerns surrounding crypto, some more legitimate than others. <a href=\"https://bariweiss.substack.com/p/the-case-against-bitcoin\">Skeptics</a> have pointed out crypto’s volatility, the environmental effects of mining, the prevalence of scams and criminal activity, the fact that private keys can still be stolen, the fact the governments are already cracking down on it….</p>\n<p>We won’t go over all of these issues right now (perhaps in another article). We admit that crypto in its current state is in need of improvement. But there is no reason to assume that none of these holes will be patched up. <a href=\"https://minaprotocol.com/about\">Blockchains are already being developed</a> to reduce energy consumption and improve security and scalability. Because of decentralization’s rise in popularity, there’s no reason to believe that the cryptocurrencies of tomorrow will be identical to Bitcoin or Ethereum.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>We’ve discussed two major use cases for decentralization in the section above, but the possibilities are truly endless. There is decentralized voting, gaming, gambling, databases, etc. etc., all free from government and corporate oversight for the most part. Decentralization is a way to bypass the various inconveniences and restrictions that limit our freedom and keep us from interacting directly. We will go into even more detail on decentralization in future articles.</p>\n<p>Like we said at the beginning of the article, we are not economists. We’re not here to tell you that decentralized software will make you a millionaire (although we have no obvious reason to believe otherwise). We are interested in decentralization because of the <em>undeniable humanitarian benefits </em>which we believe are catching on!</p>\n<h3>SafeHouse</h3>\n<p>SafeHouse believes in the mission of decentralization and hopes to use it to protect small businesses.

It’s responsible for securing most, if not all of your personal and financial data. There are special CPU instructions for it. It is the only cryptographic algorithm approved by the NSA.</p>\n<p>We’re of course talking about the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), the most commonplace and secure symmetric encryption algorithm yet developed.</p>\n<p>This will be the longest article we write for the time being 😊. We’re going to take a deep dive into how this algorithm works. Modern cryptographic algorithms are by no means trivial; they use concepts from advanced mathematics to achieve a high level of security. But we don’t expect you to be a mathematician.</p>\n<p>While there are many articles about AES, most of them are either too technical or leave out important information. With this article we hope to strike the perfect balance between comprehensiveness and accessibility. However, we must admit that this article will require some level of comfort with math, as mathematical concepts are introduced here.</p>\n<p>It must be stated that you should not try to implement AES by yourself in a production application, or risk a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack\">side channel attack</a>. Use the many free <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_cryptography_libraries\">cryptographic libraries</a> that offer tested implementations of whatever algorithms you need.</p>\n<h3>The Basics</h3>\n<p>First, a brief refresher on what AES is.</p>\n<p>AES is not the name of the algorithm itself, but a title awarded by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to the algorithm they deemed to be the de facto standard for encryption. The actual name of the algorithm is <em>Rijndael</em>, and it was selected by the NIST over a number of algorithms to replace the former standard, known as DES (Data Encryption Standard). Rijndael was approved by the NIST in 2001 and adopted by the US government in 2002. It remains the standard cipher used by the US government and institutions across the world.</p>\n<p>AES is a <em>symmetric cipher</em>, which means that a single key is used to encrypt <em>and</em> decrypt the same data. AES can be performed with the following key sizes: <strong>128 bits, 196 bits and 256 bits</strong>. Generally, increasing the key size also increases the level of security. Rijndael works for any key size that is a multiple of 32 bits, but the NIST chose specific sizes (and other parameters) that balance performance and security.</p>\n<p>It is also a <em>block cipher</em>, meaning that the data is divided into blocks before encryption. AES divides plaintext into blocks of 16 bytes (128 bits).</p>\n<h3>Algorithm Overview</h3>\n<p>The gist of AES is this: we arrange each block of the plaintext into a 4x4 matrix and repeatedly perform a set of operations on it. We call each iteration a <em>round</em>, and we perform <strong>10, 12 or 14 rounds</strong> depending on the key length (this is another parameter chosen by NIST):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>10 rounds for a 128-bit key</li>\n<li>12 rounds for a 196-bit key</li>\n<li>14 rounds for a 256 bit key</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For each round, we generate a <em>round key </em>from the main key using the <em>Rijndael Key Schedule</em>.</p>\n<p>There are four operations on the 4x4 matrix that we will define:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>subBytes()</li>\n<li>shiftRows()</li>\n<li>mixColumns()</li>\n<li>addRoundKey()</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Not every round of operations is the same; for the first round, we only add the round key, and for the last round we omit the mixColumns() step. So the pseudocode for the AES algorithm might look something like this:</p>\n<pre>function AESencrypt(plaintext, key) {<br><br>  blocks := divideIntoBlocks(plaintext);<br>  roundKeys = getRoundKeys(key)</pre>\n<pre>  for (block in blocks) {</pre>\n<pre>    //first round<br>    addRoundKey(roundKeys[0], block);</pre>\n<pre>    //intermediate rounds<br>    for (8, 10 or 12 rounds) {<br>      subBytes(block);<br>      shiftRows(block);<br>      mixColumns(block);<br>      addRoundKey(roundKeys[..], block);<br>    }</pre>\n<pre>    //last round<br>    subBytes(block);<br>    shiftRows(block);<br>    addRoundKey(roundKeys[numRounds - 1], block);</pre>\n<pre>  }</pre>\n<pre>  ciphertext := reassemble(blocks);<br>  return ciphertext;</pre>\n<pre>}</pre>\n<h3>Mathematical Background</h3>\n<p>This section may appear rather esoteric. We told you we would explain AES in detail and we weren’t lying. Luckily, we believe that the concepts in this section can be understood with only high-school level math and basic programming experience. Don’t let the fancy words throw you off!</p>\n<p>Let’s introduce a concept in abstract algebra called a <em>Galois field</em> or <em>finite field</em>. A <em>field</em> is a set (meaning a collection of objects) with operations that act on the set and behave similarly to addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. In other words, the operations satisfy a number of properties that also hold true for addition/subtraction/multiplication/division over the rational numbers. In fact, the rational and real numbers with these four operations qualify as a field. The <em>finite</em> qualifier just means that the set has a finite number of elements.</p>\n<p>We won’t go into the specific definition of a field. Just think of it as a set of numbers where addition, subtraction, multiplication and division are redefined.</p>\n<p>AES uses a specific Galois field, which we will call <em>Rijndael’s finite field</em>, to perform many essential operations. In particular, it uses GF(2⁸) with irreducible polynomial <em>x</em>⁸ +<em> x</em>⁴ + <em>x</em>³ + <em>x</em> + 1. You’ll understand what this means in a bit.</p>\n<p>The Galois field GF(<em>pⁿ</em>), where <em>p</em> is prime and <em>n</em> is a positive integer, denotes the field with <em>pⁿ </em>elements<em>. </em>For example, the field GF(8) (or GF(2³)) contains all integers from 0 to 7. An important property of Galois fields is that the elements of the field GF(<em>pⁿ</em>) are <strong>all polynomials of degree less than n with non-negative coefficients, evaluated at p</strong><em>. p</em> is called the <em>characteristic</em> of the field.</p>\n<p>Let’s look at GF(8), or GF(2³), again. GF(2³) contains {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, which can be equivalently represented as {0, 1, 2, 2 + 1, 2², 2²+ 1, 2²+ 2, 2²+ 2 + 1}, or {0, 1, <em>x</em>, <em>x</em>+ 1, <em>x</em>², <em>x</em>² + 1, <em>x</em>² + <em>x</em>, <em>x</em>² + <em>x</em>+ 1} where <em>x</em> = 2.</p>\n<p>With this notation out of the way, we can now explain how addition/subtraction/multiplication/division works with Galois fields.</p>\n<h4><strong>Addition/Subtraction</strong></h4>\n<p>Suppose we want to add elements <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> of GF(<em>pⁿ</em>). First, convert them to their polynomial forms, that is, write them as sums of powers of <em>p</em>. Then we add the polynomials together, but with a caveat: for each coefficient <em>a_k</em> in <em>a(p)</em>, <em>b_k</em> in <em>b(p)</em>, the resulting coefficient <em>c_k </em>is equal to <em>a_k</em> + <em>b_k</em> mod <em>p</em>. For subtraction, the formula is <em>c_k</em> = <em>a_k</em> — <em>b_k</em> mod <em>p</em>.</p>\n<p>We apologize for Medium’s lack of support for mathematical expressions. Here are the formulas again in LaTeX:</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/544/1*b32ra3kUxYZx0PAk-fBF0g.png\"></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/584/1*-XPMYNDqSAghS8q8jizwpA.png\"></figure><p>“mod” of course stands for modulo, which in most programming languages is written as “%”. Let’s look at an example:</p>\n<p>74 + 26 in GF(3⁴) = (2 * 3³ + 2 * 3² + 2 * 1) + (2 * 3² + 2 * 3 + 2 * 1)</p>\n<p>= (2 * 3³ + 4 * 3² + 2 * 3 + 4 * 1) = (2 * 3³ + 3² + 6 + 1) = <strong>70</strong></p>\n<p>Notice that 4 * 3² became 3² and 4 * 1 became 1 because of the modulo operation on the coefficients.</p>\n<p>The Rijndael field GF(2⁸), as well as all fields with characteristic 2, share a property that makes them well suited for computers: <strong>addition and subtraction are equivalent to the bitwise exclusive or (XOR/⊕) operation.</strong> This works because <strong>each term in the polynomial represents a bit.</strong> Here is another example to demonstrate this fact:</p>\n<p>15 + 12 in GF(2⁴) = (2³ + 2² + 2 + 1) + (2³ + 2²)</p>\n<p>= (2 * 2³ + 2 * 2² + 2 + 1) = (2 + 1) = <strong>3</strong></p>\n<p>15 ⊕ 12 = 0b1111 ⊕ 0b1100 = 0b0011 = <strong>3</strong></p>\n<p>Addition in Galois fields is often referred to as “carryless addition.” We add each set of digits independently modulo <em>p</em>. Note that in the example above, the first set of digits adds to 2 mod 2 = 0, while the second set adds to 7 mod 2 = 3.</p>\n<h4><strong>Multiplication</strong></h4>\n<p>In order to multiply two polynomials <em>a(p)</em> and <em>b(p)</em> in GF(<em>pⁿ</em>), we need to chose a third polynomial <em>m(p) </em>that <em>cannot be factored</em> and has a degree of at least <em>n</em>. We call m(p) the irreducible polynomial.</p>\n<p>To multiply <em>a(p)</em> and <em>b(p) in </em>GF(<em>pⁿ</em>) we perform the following steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Multiply <em>a(p)</em> and <em>b(p) </em>like normal</li>\n<li>Reduce the coefficients of the resulting polynomial modulo p.</li>\n<li>Reduce the entire polynomial mod <em>m(p). </em>This is so our final answer stays less than<em> pⁿ.</em>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The final step can be performed using polynomial long division. <strong>However, this is no ordinary division<em>.</em> Every arithmetic operation we perform during the process must be the finite field’s version.</strong> In the case of GF(2⁸), every time we perform “subtraction”, we actually perform the XOR operation. Representing the polynomials as binary strings will be helpful for this step.</p>\n<p>Let’s perform 193 * 56 in GF(2⁸) and with <em>m(p)</em> = <em>x</em>⁸ +<em> x</em>⁴ + <em>x</em>³ + <em>x</em> + 1 (Rijndael’s field):</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*rc1od0FZUReYTN0q6MJAow.png\"></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*QdgLMbTc2cpGQEC3UXjZfw.png\"></figure><p>If multiplication in finite fields seems complicated, don’t worry! With Rijndael’s field, the multiplication algorithm can be greatly optimized beyond what is described above. Below is a pseudocode implementation:</p>\n<pre>function gmul(a : byte, b : byte) {</pre>\n<pre>  p : byte = 0x00;<br><br>  for (8 rounds) {</pre>\n<pre>    //if low bit of b is set<br>    if ((b &amp; 1) != 0) {<br>      p = p ⊕ a;<br>    }<br><br>    //true if the high bit of a is set<br>    h : bool = (a &amp; 0x80) != 0;</pre>\n<pre>    a = a &lt;&lt; 1; //shift left<br><br>    if (h) {<br>      a = a ⊕ 0x1B; //value of the polynomial m(p) (0x11B) with the high bit removed<br>    }</pre>\n<pre>    b = b &gt;&gt; 1; //right shift</pre>\n<pre>   return p;</pre>\n<pre>  }  <br>}</pre>\n<h4>The Multiplicative Inverse/Division</h4>\n<p>The multiplicative inverse of a polynomial a(p) is the polynomial b(p) such that a(p) * b(p) mod m(p) = 1. Multiplicative inverses can be found by applying the inverse of the algorithm above. Division is simply a matter of multiplying the first operand by the multiplicative inverse of the second.</p>\n<h4><strong>What’s the point?</strong></h4>\n<p>Why does AES borrow concepts from finite field theory. The main reason is performance. Remember that “addition” in GF(2⁸) is the same as the XOR operation. Also consider that there is no need to worry about overflow/underflow, because the inputs and outputs of the operations are restricted to the numbers 0–255.</p>\n<p>Multiplication is less complicated than it looks. To put things in perspective, consider how computers perform normal multiplication at the lowest level: through repeated bit shifts and additions (of course, we don’t have special circuitry to perform GF(2⁸) arithmetic). Finally, multiplication by 2 and 3 is very easy to optimize. This will become important later.</p>\n<pre>//multiply by 2 in GF(2^8)<br>function gmul2(a : byte) {</pre>\n<pre>  h : byte = a &amp; 0x80; //high bit</pre>\n<pre>  b : byte = a &lt;&lt; 1;</pre>\n<pre>  if (h == 0x80) b = b ⊕ 0x1b;</pre>\n<pre>  return b; </pre>\n<pre>}</pre>\n<pre>//multiply by 3 in GF(2^8)<br>function gmul3(a : byte) {</pre>\n<pre>  return a ⊕ gmul2(a);</pre>\n<pre>}</pre>\n<h3>Key Expansion</h3>\n<p>We’re done with background! Now it’s time to look into the nitty-gritty of what AES actually does.</p>\n<p>Before any encryption takes place, separate 128-bit keys must be generated for each round. Rijndael uses a specific algorithm to generate round keys.</p>\n<p>The Rijndael key schedule performs a number of operations:</p>\n<p><strong>rotate():</strong> rotates a 32-bit (4 byte) word 8 bits to the left. As an example: rotate(0xab157c9e) = 0x157c9eab.</p>\n<p><strong>rcon():</strong> exponentiates (repeatedly multiplies) 2 to a specified value in Rijndael’s finite field. This operation can be described by the pseudocode below. However, we will only need to use a maximum of 11 rcon() values, so a lookup table is sufficient.</p>\n<pre>function rcon(value : unsigned int) {</pre>\n<pre>  c : byte = 1;<br><br>  if (value == 0) return 0;<br>  while (value != 1) {<br>    c = gmul(c, 2);<br>    value--;<br>  }</pre>\n<pre>  return c;</pre>\n<pre>}</pre>\n<p>We have not yet explained how exponentiation works for finite fields. In short, it works very similarly to normal mathematics. We encourage curious readers to do their own research if they want to learn more.</p>\n<p><strong>sbox():</strong> another operation in Rijndael’s field, usually implemented with the following lookup table:</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*jS3HSAr5mIotBFA0EXgW1A.png\"></figure><p>Mathematically, sbox() is a two part operation. First, we take the multiplicative inverse of the input. The result is represented as an eight-element vector (one for each bit) and undergoes the following transformation:</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*-l0Y4dkfLh-KEpUlNuoy_Q.png\"></figure><p>The entire process is performed with Rijndael’s finite field arithmetic. So at the end, for example, the byte 0b11000110 is not added, but <strong>XOR’ed</strong> with the matrix-vector product. This transformation is more succinctly represented as a series of XORs and left bitwise rotations like so:</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*hn53zg152FwaSqwu6ECvyQ.png\"></figure><p>The sbox() operation heavily contributes to the security of AES as a whole. It is resistant to <strong>linear cryptoanalysis</strong> in that it is hard to approximate with a linear transformation. It is also resistant to <strong>differential cryptoanalysis</strong> in that there seems to be no correlation between how the input changes and how the output changes. Finally, sbox() is special in that there are no <strong>fixed points</strong>, i.e. there are no situations where the input equals the output.</p>\n<p>The key expansion algorithm works mainly on 32-bit words instead of bytes. For the future, we will define <strong>subWord() </strong>as the application of sbox() on each byte of a word.</p>\n<h4>The Key Expansion Algorithm</h4>\n<p>Onto the actual key-generation algorithm. Let’s define some constants before we take a look at the steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Let K[0] thru K[N-1] represent the 32-bit words of the original key.</li>\n<li>Let N equal the length of the original key in 32-bit words <strong>(4, 6, or 8 for a 128, 192 or 256-bit key respectively).</strong>\n</li>\n<li>Let R equal the number of rounds <strong>(10, 12, or 15 for a 128, 192 or 256-bit key respectively).</strong>\n</li>\n<li>Let W[0] thru W[4R-1] represent the 32-bit words comprising all of the round keys. Let’s call this the expanded key.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The key expansion algorithm iterates through all of the 32-bit words W[0] thru W[4R-1]. When we want a specific round key, we combine the four words (128 bits) from of the expanded key corresponding to that round. For example, the Round 3 Key comprises of W[8] thru W[11].</p>\n<p>The algorithm goes like this:</p>\n<pre>for (i from 0 to 4R - 1) {</pre>\n<pre>  //The first words (W[0] thru W[N-1]) are equal to the words of the original key.<br>  //For a 128-bit key, this means that the first round key is equal to the original key.<br>  if (0 &lt; i &lt; N) W[i] = K[i];</pre>\n<pre>  //Perform operations on the last word of each N-length cycle before XOR-ing.<br>  else if (i &gt;= N and i == 0 mod N)<br>    W[i] = W[i-N] <strong>⊕ </strong>subWord(rotate(W[i-1])) <strong>⊕ </strong>rcon(i/N);</pre>\n<pre>  //For a 256-bit key length only.<br>  else if (i &gt;= N and N == 8 and i == 4 mod N)<br>    W[i] = W[i-N] <strong>⊕ </strong>subWord(W[i-1])<strong>;</strong></pre>\n<pre>  //Typical case<br>  else W[i] = W[i-N] <strong>⊕ </strong>W[i-1];</pre>\n<pre>}</pre>\n<p>The gist of the algorithm is this: generally, each word is the previous word XOR’ed with the word N places behind it. But every N words, we perform various GF(2⁸) operations on the word N places behind before the XOR-ing takes place.</p>\n<h3>An AES Round, Step-by-Step</h3>\n<p>In this section we will take you through an entire AES round. Remember that the first round only contains the addRoundKey() step. We will be going over every step, so imagine that the first round has already passed and that we are now on the second round.</p>\n<p>Let’s say we want to encrypt the following message:</p>\n<blockquote>The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog</blockquote>\n<p>We will look only how the first block is encrypted, containing “The quick brown ”. Rearranged into a 4x4 matrix, the block looks like this:</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/456/1*Vun6MZNz5WVwvFY6JyflXQ.png\"></figure><p>And here it is again in hexadecimal:</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/452/1*uVKDa77gjVgsfdaZNpxxzg.png\"></figure><h4>subBytes()</h4>\n<p>This is the first step in the AES round. We perform the sbox() operation on each byte in the matrix (see the Key Expansion section for details).</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RmhHKWYNXTdJbP4N0gZrAg.png\"></figure><h4>shiftRows()</h4>\n<p>For this step, we rotate each row to the left a number of spaces corresponding to the row number. The first row is shifted zero spaces, the second is shifted one space, and so on.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*XCto0rabgzk8CjtfubHGbQ.png\"></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*S1K2igpNY813n4gV643ixw.png\"></figure><h4>mixColumns()</h4>\n<p>Now we multiply each column by the following matrix using GF(2⁸) arithmetic (gmul() and XOR instead of normal addition and multiplication):</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/262/1*E0POvJgWhIcwAM7IonSyyg.png\"></figure><p>The entire transformation looks like this:</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/610/1*WxfxSc5kHtxlwrJnvOkVhA.png\"></figure><p>Notice that this transformation involves many multiplications by 2 and by 3. This is where the optimizations mentioned at the end of the “Mathematical Background” section come into play.</p>\n<p>In our example applying the transformation to each column looks like this:</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*sCWXX9VppD-b6g6GrwcsvA.png\"></figure><p>Both the shiftRows() and mixColumns() steps add <strong>diffusion</strong> to the cipher in that they allow small changes in the plaintext to affect the entirety of the ciphertext.</p>\n<h4>addRoundKey()</h4>\n<p>This is the easiest step. We XOR each byte in the block with its respective byte in the round key. Let’s assume that the round key for this round is:</p>\n<blockquote>abcdefghijklmnop</blockquote>\n<p>In hexadecimal this is:</p>\n<blockquote>61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 6a 6b 6c 6d 6e 6f 70</blockquote>\n<p>Keep in mind that this is a very unrealistic scenario. The round key should be pseudorandom, as well as the cipher key.</p>\n<p>The result of addRoundKey() in our example looks like this:</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*fXQ5360UIv3GAbiYCeJYvw.png\"></figure><p>Converted back to ASCII the result of a single AES round looks like this:</p>\n<blockquote>1SFÒ½Ë%Èm¸P«¯</blockquote>\n<p>As you can see, the original message is already ridiculously scrambled. Magnify this by as much as fourteen times and make sure the keys are random, and you have a level of security that not even the best computers can crack.</p>\n<h3>Decryption</h3>\n<p>So we have our encrypted message. How to we reverse the long and complicated process that is AES? One of the great things about <em>AES is </em>that<em> every action has its inverse.</em></p>\n<p>Decryption works like this: we generate the round keys using the same process. Then we perform the encryption algorithm in <em>reverse</em> using the inverses of the various operations.</p>\n<p>The addKeys() step is it’s own inverse. XOR-ing string <em>A</em> with string <em>B</em> twice simply results in <em>A</em>. We just have to remember to use the final encryption round key as the first decryption round key, the second-to-last as the second, and so on.</p>\n<p>For the mixColums() step, we apply the <em>inverse</em> of the matrix described above to all of the columns. The transformation looks like this:</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zUUllEswFhKSgt4AAO3JBA.png\"></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*OLYNV1RDKelE9ekkJ01o0Q.png\"></figure><p>For the shiftRows() step, we simply rotate the rows in the opposite direction. Or alternatively, rotate each row in the same direction a different number of spaces. If a byte is in row two, it will be rotated 1 space to the left during encryption, and 1 space to the right/3 spaces to the left during decryption.</p>\n<p>Finally, for the subBytes() step, we apply the <em>inverse</em> of the sbox() operation. Remember that we usually use a lookup table for sbox(). We can also use a lookup table for the inverse, which looks like this:</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*m4LV9AzaTnkE9Rk44BlXfA.png\"></figure><p>One last thing: we need to remember that not all of the rounds are the same. Because we perform just addRoundKey() during the first round of encryption, we do the same for the final round of decryption. Because we omit mixColumns() from the final round of encryption, we must do so for the first round of decryption.</p>\n<p>The pseudocode for the entire decryption process looks like this:</p>\n<pre>function AESdecrypt(ciphertext, key) {<br><br>  blocks := divideIntoBlocks(ciphertext);<br>  roundKeys = getRoundKeys(key)</pre>\n<pre>  for (block in blocks) {</pre>\n<pre>    //first round<br>    addRoundKey(roundKeys[numRounds - 1], block);<br>    shiftRowsInv(block);<br>    subBytesInv(block);</pre>\n<pre>    //intermediate rounds<br>    for (8, 10 or 12 rounds) {<br>      addRoundKey(roundKeys[..], block);<br>      mixColumnsInv(block);<br>      shiftRowsInv(block);<br>      subBytesInv(block);<br>    }</pre>\n<pre>    //last round<br>    addRoundKey(roundKeys[0], block);</pre>\n<pre>}</pre>\n<pre>  plaintext := reassemble(blocks);<br>  return plaintext;</pre>\n<pre>}</pre>\n<h3>SafeHouse</h3>\n<p>We’re done! We’ve explained basically everything. With this knowledge you should be able to implement AES yourself, although we highly discourage it.</p>\n<p>We at SafeHouse believe that cybersecurity is for everyone, so we’re glad to present info like this in an accessible manner.

It’s responsible for securing most, if not all of your personal and financial data. There are special CPU instructions for it. It is the only cryptographic algorithm approved by the NSA.</p>\n<p>We’re of course talking about the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), the most commonplace and secure symmetric encryption algorithm yet developed.</p>\n<p>This will be the longest article we write for the time being 😊. We’re going to take a deep dive into how this algorithm works. Modern cryptographic algorithms are by no means trivial; they use concepts from advanced mathematics to achieve a high level of security. But we don’t expect you to be a mathematician.</p>\n<p>While there are many articles about AES, most of them are either too technical or leave out important information. With this article we hope to strike the perfect balance between comprehensiveness and accessibility. However, we must admit that this article will require some level of comfort with math, as mathematical concepts are introduced here.</p>\n<p>It must be stated that you should not try to implement AES by yourself in a production application, or risk a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack\">side channel attack</a>. Use the many free <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_cryptography_libraries\">cryptographic libraries</a> that offer tested implementations of whatever algorithms you need.</p>\n<h3>The Basics</h3>\n<p>First, a brief refresher on what AES is.</p>\n<p>AES is not the name of the algorithm itself, but a title awarded by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to the algorithm they deemed to be the de facto standard for encryption. The actual name of the algorithm is <em>Rijndael</em>, and it was selected by the NIST over a number of algorithms to replace the former standard, known as DES (Data Encryption Standard). Rijndael was approved by the NIST in 2001 and adopted by the US government in 2002. It remains the standard cipher used by the US government and institutions across the world.</p>\n<p>AES is a <em>symmetric cipher</em>, which means that a single key is used to encrypt <em>and</em> decrypt the same data. AES can be performed with the following key sizes: <strong>128 bits, 196 bits and 256 bits</strong>. Generally, increasing the key size also increases the level of security. Rijndael works for any key size that is a multiple of 32 bits, but the NIST chose specific sizes (and other parameters) that balance performance and security.</p>\n<p>It is also a <em>block cipher</em>, meaning that the data is divided into blocks before encryption. AES divides plaintext into blocks of 16 bytes (128 bits).</p>\n<h3>Algorithm Overview</h3>\n<p>The gist of AES is this: we arrange each block of the plaintext into a 4x4 matrix and repeatedly perform a set of operations on it. We call each iteration a <em>round</em>, and we perform <strong>10, 12 or 14 rounds</strong> depending on the key length (this is another parameter chosen by NIST):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>10 rounds for a 128-bit key</li>\n<li>12 rounds for a 196-bit key</li>\n<li>14 rounds for a 256 bit key</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For each round, we generate a <em>round key </em>from the main key using the <em>Rijndael Key Schedule</em>.</p>\n<p>There are four operations on the 4x4 matrix that we will define:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>subBytes()</li>\n<li>shiftRows()</li>\n<li>mixColumns()</li>\n<li>addRoundKey()</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Not every round of operations is the same; for the first round, we only add the round key, and for the last round we omit the mixColumns() step. So the pseudocode for the AES algorithm might look something like this:</p>\n<pre>function AESencrypt(plaintext, key) {<br><br>  blocks := divideIntoBlocks(plaintext);<br>  roundKeys = getRoundKeys(key)</pre>\n<pre>  for (block in blocks) {</pre>\n<pre>    //first round<br>    addRoundKey(roundKeys[0], block);</pre>\n<pre>    //intermediate rounds<br>    for (8, 10 or 12 rounds) {<br>      subBytes(block);<br>      shiftRows(block);<br>      mixColumns(block);<br>      addRoundKey(roundKeys[..], block);<br>    }</pre>\n<pre>    //last round<br>    subBytes(block);<br>    shiftRows(block);<br>    addRoundKey(roundKeys[numRounds - 1], block);</pre>\n<pre>  }</pre>\n<pre>  ciphertext := reassemble(blocks);<br>  return ciphertext;</pre>\n<pre>}</pre>\n<h3>Mathematical Background</h3>\n<p>This section may appear rather esoteric. We told you we would explain AES in detail and we weren’t lying. Luckily, we believe that the concepts in this section can be understood with only high-school level math and basic programming experience. Don’t let the fancy words throw you off!</p>\n<p>Let’s introduce a concept in abstract algebra called a <em>Galois field</em> or <em>finite field</em>. A <em>field</em> is a set (meaning a collection of objects) with operations that act on the set and behave similarly to addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. In other words, the operations satisfy a number of properties that also hold true for addition/subtraction/multiplication/division over the rational numbers. In fact, the rational and real numbers with these four operations qualify as a field. The <em>finite</em> qualifier just means that the set has a finite number of elements.</p>\n<p>We won’t go into the specific definition of a field. Just think of it as a set of numbers where addition, subtraction, multiplication and division are redefined.</p>\n<p>AES uses a specific Galois field, which we will call <em>Rijndael’s finite field</em>, to perform many essential operations. In particular, it uses GF(2⁸) with irreducible polynomial <em>x</em>⁸ +<em> x</em>⁴ + <em>x</em>³ + <em>x</em> + 1. You’ll understand what this means in a bit.</p>\n<p>The Galois field GF(<em>pⁿ</em>), where <em>p</em> is prime and <em>n</em> is a positive integer, denotes the field with <em>pⁿ </em>elements<em>. </em>For example, the field GF(8) (or GF(2³)) contains all integers from 0 to 7. An important property of Galois fields is that the elements of the field GF(<em>pⁿ</em>) are <strong>all polynomials of degree less than n with non-negative coefficients, evaluated at p</strong><em>. p</em> is called the <em>characteristic</em> of the field.</p>\n<p>Let’s look at GF(8), or GF(2³), again. GF(2³) contains {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, which can be equivalently represented as {0, 1, 2, 2 + 1, 2², 2²+ 1, 2²+ 2, 2²+ 2 + 1}, or {0, 1, <em>x</em>, <em>x</em>+ 1, <em>x</em>², <em>x</em>² + 1, <em>x</em>² + <em>x</em>, <em>x</em>² + <em>x</em>+ 1} where <em>x</em> = 2.</p>\n<p>With this notation out of the way, we can now explain how addition/subtraction/multiplication/division works with Galois fields.</p>\n<h4><strong>Addition/Subtraction</strong></h4>\n<p>Suppose we want to add elements <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> of GF(<em>pⁿ</em>). First, convert them to their polynomial forms, that is, write them as sums of powers of <em>p</em>. Then we add the polynomials together, but with a caveat: for each coefficient <em>a_k</em> in <em>a(p)</em>, <em>b_k</em> in <em>b(p)</em>, the resulting coefficient <em>c_k </em>is equal to <em>a_k</em> + <em>b_k</em> mod <em>p</em>. For subtraction, the formula is <em>c_k</em> = <em>a_k</em> — <em>b_k</em> mod <em>p</em>.</p>\n<p>We apologize for Medium’s lack of support for mathematical expressions. Here are the formulas again in LaTeX:</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/544/1*b32ra3kUxYZx0PAk-fBF0g.png\"></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/584/1*-XPMYNDqSAghS8q8jizwpA.png\"></figure><p>“mod” of course stands for modulo, which in most programming languages is written as “%”. Let’s look at an example:</p>\n<p>74 + 26 in GF(3⁴) = (2 * 3³ + 2 * 3² + 2 * 1) + (2 * 3² + 2 * 3 + 2 * 1)</p>\n<p>= (2 * 3³ + 4 * 3² + 2 * 3 + 4 * 1) = (2 * 3³ + 3² + 6 + 1) = <strong>70</strong></p>\n<p>Notice that 4 * 3² became 3² and 4 * 1 became 1 because of the modulo operation on the coefficients.</p>\n<p>The Rijndael field GF(2⁸), as well as all fields with characteristic 2, share a property that makes them well suited for computers: <strong>addition and subtraction are equivalent to the bitwise exclusive or (XOR/⊕) operation.</strong> This works because <strong>each term in the polynomial represents a bit.</strong> Here is another example to demonstrate this fact:</p>\n<p>15 + 12 in GF(2⁴) = (2³ + 2² + 2 + 1) + (2³ + 2²)</p>\n<p>= (2 * 2³ + 2 * 2² + 2 + 1) = (2 + 1) = <strong>3</strong></p>\n<p>15 ⊕ 12 = 0b1111 ⊕ 0b1100 = 0b0011 = <strong>3</strong></p>\n<p>Addition in Galois fields is often referred to as “carryless addition.” We add each set of digits independently modulo <em>p</em>. Note that in the example above, the first set of digits adds to 2 mod 2 = 0, while the second set adds to 7 mod 2 = 3.</p>\n<h4><strong>Multiplication</strong></h4>\n<p>In order to multiply two polynomials <em>a(p)</em> and <em>b(p)</em> in GF(<em>pⁿ</em>), we need to chose a third polynomial <em>m(p) </em>that <em>cannot be factored</em> and has a degree of at least <em>n</em>. We call m(p) the irreducible polynomial.</p>\n<p>To multiply <em>a(p)</em> and <em>b(p) in </em>GF(<em>pⁿ</em>) we perform the following steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Multiply <em>a(p)</em> and <em>b(p) </em>like normal</li>\n<li>Reduce the coefficients of the resulting polynomial modulo p.</li>\n<li>Reduce the entire polynomial mod <em>m(p). </em>This is so our final answer stays less than<em> pⁿ.</em>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The final step can be performed using polynomial long division. <strong>However, this is no ordinary division<em>.</em> Every arithmetic operation we perform during the process must be the finite field’s version.</strong> In the case of GF(2⁸), every time we perform “subtraction”, we actually perform the XOR operation. Representing the polynomials as binary strings will be helpful for this step.</p>\n<p>Let’s perform 193 * 56 in GF(2⁸) and with <em>m(p)</em> = <em>x</em>⁸ +<em> x</em>⁴ + <em>x</em>³ + <em>x</em> + 1 (Rijndael’s field):</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*rc1od0FZUReYTN0q6MJAow.png\"></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*QdgLMbTc2cpGQEC3UXjZfw.png\"></figure><p>If multiplication in finite fields seems complicated, don’t worry! With Rijndael’s field, the multiplication algorithm can be greatly optimized beyond what is described above. Below is a pseudocode implementation:</p>\n<pre>function gmul(a : byte, b : byte) {</pre>\n<pre>  p : byte = 0x00;<br><br>  for (8 rounds) {</pre>\n<pre>    //if low bit of b is set<br>    if ((b &amp; 1) != 0) {<br>      p = p ⊕ a;<br>    }<br><br>    //true if the high bit of a is set<br>    h : bool = (a &amp; 0x80) != 0;</pre>\n<pre>    a = a &lt;&lt; 1; //shift left<br><br>    if (h) {<br>      a = a ⊕ 0x1B; //value of the polynomial m(p) (0x11B) with the high bit removed<br>    }</pre>\n<pre>    b = b &gt;&gt; 1; //right shift</pre>\n<pre>   return p;</pre>\n<pre>  }  <br>}</pre>\n<h4>The Multiplicative Inverse/Division</h4>\n<p>The multiplicative inverse of a polynomial a(p) is the polynomial b(p) such that a(p) * b(p) mod m(p) = 1. Multiplicative inverses can be found by applying the inverse of the algorithm above. Division is simply a matter of multiplying the first operand by the multiplicative inverse of the second.</p>\n<h4><strong>What’s the point?</strong></h4>\n<p>Why does AES borrow concepts from finite field theory. The main reason is performance. Remember that “addition” in GF(2⁸) is the same as the XOR operation. Also consider that there is no need to worry about overflow/underflow, because the inputs and outputs of the operations are restricted to the numbers 0–255.</p>\n<p>Multiplication is less complicated than it looks. To put things in perspective, consider how computers perform normal multiplication at the lowest level: through repeated bit shifts and additions (of course, we don’t have special circuitry to perform GF(2⁸) arithmetic). Finally, multiplication by 2 and 3 is very easy to optimize. This will become important later.</p>\n<pre>//multiply by 2 in GF(2^8)<br>function gmul2(a : byte) {</pre>\n<pre>  h : byte = a &amp; 0x80; //high bit</pre>\n<pre>  b : byte = a &lt;&lt; 1;</pre>\n<pre>  if (h == 0x80) b = b ⊕ 0x1b;</pre>\n<pre>  return b; </pre>\n<pre>}</pre>\n<pre>//multiply by 3 in GF(2^8)<br>function gmul3(a : byte) {</pre>\n<pre>  return a ⊕ gmul2(a);</pre>\n<pre>}</pre>\n<h3>Key Expansion</h3>\n<p>We’re done with background! Now it’s time to look into the nitty-gritty of what AES actually does.</p>\n<p>Before any encryption takes place, separate 128-bit keys must be generated for each round. Rijndael uses a specific algorithm to generate round keys.</p>\n<p>The Rijndael key schedule performs a number of operations:</p>\n<p><strong>rotate():</strong> rotates a 32-bit (4 byte) word 8 bits to the left. As an example: rotate(0xab157c9e) = 0x157c9eab.</p>\n<p><strong>rcon():</strong> exponentiates (repeatedly multiplies) 2 to a specified value in Rijndael’s finite field. This operation can be described by the pseudocode below. However, we will only need to use a maximum of 11 rcon() values, so a lookup table is sufficient.</p>\n<pre>function rcon(value : unsigned int) {</pre>\n<pre>  c : byte = 1;<br><br>  if (value == 0) return 0;<br>  while (value != 1) {<br>    c = gmul(c, 2);<br>    value--;<br>  }</pre>\n<pre>  return c;</pre>\n<pre>}</pre>\n<p>We have not yet explained how exponentiation works for finite fields. In short, it works very similarly to normal mathematics. We encourage curious readers to do their own research if they want to learn more.</p>\n<p><strong>sbox():</strong> another operation in Rijndael’s field, usually implemented with the following lookup table:</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*jS3HSAr5mIotBFA0EXgW1A.png\"></figure><p>Mathematically, sbox() is a two part operation. First, we take the multiplicative inverse of the input. The result is represented as an eight-element vector (one for each bit) and undergoes the following transformation:</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*-l0Y4dkfLh-KEpUlNuoy_Q.png\"></figure><p>The entire process is performed with Rijndael’s finite field arithmetic. So at the end, for example, the byte 0b11000110 is not added, but <strong>XOR’ed</strong> with the matrix-vector product. This transformation is more succinctly represented as a series of XORs and left bitwise rotations like so:</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*hn53zg152FwaSqwu6ECvyQ.png\"></figure><p>The sbox() operation heavily contributes to the security of AES as a whole. It is resistant to <strong>linear cryptoanalysis</strong> in that it is hard to approximate with a linear transformation. It is also resistant to <strong>differential cryptoanalysis</strong> in that there seems to be no correlation between how the input changes and how the output changes. Finally, sbox() is special in that there are no <strong>fixed points</strong>, i.e. there are no situations where the input equals the output.</p>\n<p>The key expansion algorithm works mainly on 32-bit words instead of bytes. For the future, we will define <strong>subWord() </strong>as the application of sbox() on each byte of a word.</p>\n<h4>The Key Expansion Algorithm</h4>\n<p>Onto the actual key-generation algorithm. Let’s define some constants before we take a look at the steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Let K[0] thru K[N-1] represent the 32-bit words of the original key.</li>\n<li>Let N equal the length of the original key in 32-bit words <strong>(4, 6, or 8 for a 128, 192 or 256-bit key respectively).</strong>\n</li>\n<li>Let R equal the number of rounds <strong>(10, 12, or 15 for a 128, 192 or 256-bit key respectively).</strong>\n</li>\n<li>Let W[0] thru W[4R-1] represent the 32-bit words comprising all of the round keys. Let’s call this the expanded key.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The key expansion algorithm iterates through all of the 32-bit words W[0] thru W[4R-1]. When we want a specific round key, we combine the four words (128 bits) from of the expanded key corresponding to that round. For example, the Round 3 Key comprises of W[8] thru W[11].</p>\n<p>The algorithm goes like this:</p>\n<pre>for (i from 0 to 4R - 1) {</pre>\n<pre>  //The first words (W[0] thru W[N-1]) are equal to the words of the original key.<br>  //For a 128-bit key, this means that the first round key is equal to the original key.<br>  if (0 &lt; i &lt; N) W[i] = K[i];</pre>\n<pre>  //Perform operations on the last word of each N-length cycle before XOR-ing.<br>  else if (i &gt;= N and i == 0 mod N)<br>    W[i] = W[i-N] <strong>⊕ </strong>subWord(rotate(W[i-1])) <strong>⊕ </strong>rcon(i/N);</pre>\n<pre>  //For a 256-bit key length only.<br>  else if (i &gt;= N and N == 8 and i == 4 mod N)<br>    W[i] = W[i-N] <strong>⊕ </strong>subWord(W[i-1])<strong>;</strong></pre>\n<pre>  //Typical case<br>  else W[i] = W[i-N] <strong>⊕ </strong>W[i-1];</pre>\n<pre>}</pre>\n<p>The gist of the algorithm is this: generally, each word is the previous word XOR’ed with the word N places behind it. But every N words, we perform various GF(2⁸) operations on the word N places behind before the XOR-ing takes place.</p>\n<h3>An AES Round, Step-by-Step</h3>\n<p>In this section we will take you through an entire AES round. Remember that the first round only contains the addRoundKey() step. We will be going over every step, so imagine that the first round has already passed and that we are now on the second round.</p>\n<p>Let’s say we want to encrypt the following message:</p>\n<blockquote>The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog</blockquote>\n<p>We will look only how the first block is encrypted, containing “The quick brown ”. Rearranged into a 4x4 matrix, the block looks like this:</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/456/1*Vun6MZNz5WVwvFY6JyflXQ.png\"></figure><p>And here it is again in hexadecimal:</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/452/1*uVKDa77gjVgsfdaZNpxxzg.png\"></figure><h4>subBytes()</h4>\n<p>This is the first step in the AES round. We perform the sbox() operation on each byte in the matrix (see the Key Expansion section for details).</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RmhHKWYNXTdJbP4N0gZrAg.png\"></figure><h4>shiftRows()</h4>\n<p>For this step, we rotate each row to the left a number of spaces corresponding to the row number. The first row is shifted zero spaces, the second is shifted one space, and so on.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*XCto0rabgzk8CjtfubHGbQ.png\"></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*S1K2igpNY813n4gV643ixw.png\"></figure><h4>mixColumns()</h4>\n<p>Now we multiply each column by the following matrix using GF(2⁸) arithmetic (gmul() and XOR instead of normal addition and multiplication):</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/262/1*E0POvJgWhIcwAM7IonSyyg.png\"></figure><p>The entire transformation looks like this:</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/610/1*WxfxSc5kHtxlwrJnvOkVhA.png\"></figure><p>Notice that this transformation involves many multiplications by 2 and by 3. This is where the optimizations mentioned at the end of the “Mathematical Background” section come into play.</p>\n<p>In our example applying the transformation to each column looks like this:</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*sCWXX9VppD-b6g6GrwcsvA.png\"></figure><p>Both the shiftRows() and mixColumns() steps add <strong>diffusion</strong> to the cipher in that they allow small changes in the plaintext to affect the entirety of the ciphertext.</p>\n<h4>addRoundKey()</h4>\n<p>This is the easiest step. We XOR each byte in the block with its respective byte in the round key. Let’s assume that the round key for this round is:</p>\n<blockquote>abcdefghijklmnop</blockquote>\n<p>In hexadecimal this is:</p>\n<blockquote>61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 6a 6b 6c 6d 6e 6f 70</blockquote>\n<p>Keep in mind that this is a very unrealistic scenario. The round key should be pseudorandom, as well as the cipher key.</p>\n<p>The result of addRoundKey() in our example looks like this:</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*fXQ5360UIv3GAbiYCeJYvw.png\"></figure><p>Converted back to ASCII the result of a single AES round looks like this:</p>\n<blockquote>1SFÒ½Ë%Èm¸P«¯</blockquote>\n<p>As you can see, the original message is already ridiculously scrambled. Magnify this by as much as fourteen times and make sure the keys are random, and you have a level of security that not even the best computers can crack.</p>\n<h3>Decryption</h3>\n<p>So we have our encrypted message. How to we reverse the long and complicated process that is AES? One of the great things about <em>AES is </em>that<em> every action has its inverse.</em></p>\n<p>Decryption works like this: we generate the round keys using the same process. Then we perform the encryption algorithm in <em>reverse</em> using the inverses of the various operations.</p>\n<p>The addKeys() step is it’s own inverse. XOR-ing string <em>A</em> with string <em>B</em> twice simply results in <em>A</em>. We just have to remember to use the final encryption round key as the first decryption round key, the second-to-last as the second, and so on.</p>\n<p>For the mixColums() step, we apply the <em>inverse</em> of the matrix described above to all of the columns. The transformation looks like this:</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zUUllEswFhKSgt4AAO3JBA.png\"></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*OLYNV1RDKelE9ekkJ01o0Q.png\"></figure><p>For the shiftRows() step, we simply rotate the rows in the opposite direction. Or alternatively, rotate each row in the same direction a different number of spaces. If a byte is in row two, it will be rotated 1 space to the left during encryption, and 1 space to the right/3 spaces to the left during decryption.</p>\n<p>Finally, for the subBytes() step, we apply the <em>inverse</em> of the sbox() operation. Remember that we usually use a lookup table for sbox(). We can also use a lookup table for the inverse, which looks like this:</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*m4LV9AzaTnkE9Rk44BlXfA.png\"></figure><p>One last thing: we need to remember that not all of the rounds are the same. Because we perform just addRoundKey() during the first round of encryption, we do the same for the final round of decryption. Because we omit mixColumns() from the final round of encryption, we must do so for the first round of decryption.</p>\n<p>The pseudocode for the entire decryption process looks like this:</p>\n<pre>function AESdecrypt(ciphertext, key) {<br><br>  blocks := divideIntoBlocks(ciphertext);<br>  roundKeys = getRoundKeys(key)</pre>\n<pre>  for (block in blocks) {</pre>\n<pre>    //first round<br>    addRoundKey(roundKeys[numRounds - 1], block);<br>    shiftRowsInv(block);<br>    subBytesInv(block);</pre>\n<pre>    //intermediate rounds<br>    for (8, 10 or 12 rounds) {<br>      addRoundKey(roundKeys[..], block);<br>      mixColumnsInv(block);<br>      shiftRowsInv(block);<br>      subBytesInv(block);<br>    }</pre>\n<pre>    //last round<br>    addRoundKey(roundKeys[0], block);</pre>\n<pre>}</pre>\n<pre>  plaintext := reassemble(blocks);<br>  return plaintext;</pre>\n<pre>}</pre>\n<h3>SafeHouse</h3>\n<p>We’re done!

Many common internet-facing applications secure data before it’s sent out into the world. But how? With an ingenious protocol known as TLS.</p>\n<h3>What is TLS?</h3>\n<p>In the olden days of the internet, communication was completely unencrypted. This meant that eavesdroppers could potentially see all of the data sent over the internet. People had to be very careful when sending sensitive information.</p>\n<p>This problem was recognized as early as 1994, so the SSL (Secure Socket Layer) protocol was developed. SSL encrypts data at one endpoint and decrypts it at the other, such that data passed between computers was completely unintelligible. Keep in mind that this protocol does not protect data sitting on your computer (“at rest”); it only protects data in transit when two computers connect to each other.</p>\n<p>TLS (Transport Layer Security) is a similar protocol to SSL and shares the same purpose. The first version was developed in 1999 and based on SSL 3.0. When SSL 3.0 was found to be insecure, it was completely replaced by TLS. TLS is used for web browsing, but can be used for a variety of services. Today, TLS 1.3 is the latest version of TLS and earlier versions should be avoided.</p>\n<p>You may have noticed when browsing the web that some URLs start with “http” and others with “https.” HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, and it is the protocol that retrieves HTML and other media to be displayed by your web browser. HTTPS is a version of HTTP with integrated TLS/SSL. In other words, accessing an “https” website means that your communications with the server are encrypted. It’s recommended that every website switch to HTTPS by purchasing an SSL certificate.</p>\n<h3>How Does TLS Work</h3>\n<p>The first question one might ask about encrypted communication is “how do both parties know how to decrypt the messages?

Many common internet-facing applications secure data before it’s sent out into the world. But how? With an ingenious protocol known as TLS.</p>\n<h3>What is TLS?</h3>\n<p>In the olden days of the internet, communication was completely unencrypted. This meant that eavesdroppers could potentially see all of the data sent over the internet. People had to be very careful when sending sensitive information.</p>\n<p>This problem was recognized as early as 1994, so the SSL (Secure Socket Layer) protocol was developed. SSL encrypts data at one endpoint and decrypts it at the other, such that data passed between computers was completely unintelligible. Keep in mind that this protocol does not protect data sitting on your computer (“at rest”); it only protects data in transit when two computers connect to each other.</p>\n<p>TLS (Transport Layer Security) is a similar protocol to SSL and shares the same purpose. The first version was developed in 1999 and based on SSL 3.0. When SSL 3.0 was found to be insecure, it was completely replaced by TLS. TLS is used for web browsing, but can be used for a variety of services. Today, TLS 1.3 is the latest version of TLS and earlier versions should be avoided.</p>\n<p>You may have noticed when browsing the web that some URLs start with “http” and others with “https.” HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, and it is the protocol that retrieves HTML and other media to be displayed by your web browser. HTTPS is a version of HTTP with integrated TLS/SSL. In other words, accessing an “https” website means that your communications with the server are encrypted. It’s recommended that every website switch to HTTPS by purchasing an SSL certificate.</p>\n<h3>How Does TLS Work</h3>\n<p>The first question one might ask about encrypted communication is “how do both parties know how to decrypt the messages? Surely they can’t just send the key over the web!” In fact, they can, and we will explain how step by step.</p>\n<p>Suppose you are a web browser and you want to connect to a website’s host.
