Many common internet-facing applications secure data before it’s sent out into the world. But how?

The first version was developed in 1999 and based on SSL 3.0. When SSL 3.0 was found to be insecure, it was completely replaced by TLS. TLS is used for web browsing, but can be used for a variety of services. Today, TLS 1.3 is the latest version of TLS and earlier versions should be avoided.</p>\n<p>You may have noticed when browsing the web that some URLs start with “http” and others with “https.” HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, and it is the protocol that retrieves HTML and other media to be displayed by your web browser. HTTPS is a version of HTTP with integrated TLS/SSL. In other words, accessing an “https” website means that your communications with the server are encrypted. It’s recommended that every website switch to HTTPS by purchasing an SSL certificate.</p>\n<h3>How Does TLS Work</h3>\n<p>The first question one might ask about encrypted communication is “how do both parties know how to decrypt the messages? Surely they can’t just send the key over the web!” In fact, they can, and we will explain how step by step.</p>\n<p>Suppose you are a web browser and you want to connect to a website’s host. The browser will conduct a conversation with the server to establish a secure channel. This conversation is called the TLS handshake.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 1: The client will send a “hello” message to the server, containing the TLS/SSL versions it is using, a list of supported cipher suites, and string of random bytes (called the <em>client random</em>).</strong></p>\n<p>What is meant by “cipher suite?” We’ll get to that. First of all, a cipher is simply an algorithm to encrypt a message. For example, replacing each letter in a message with a number is a type of cipher. But the ones used by TLS are far more complicated and impossible to break by humans or computers alike.</p>\n<p>A cipher can be <em>symmetric</em> or <em>asymmetric</em>. A symmetric cipher is one in which a single key is used to encrypt and decrypt the message. They are most useful when only you want to see the contents of the message, since sharing the key is a security risk. The most common symmetric cipher used by TLS is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard\">AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)</a>.</p>\n<p>Asymmetric ciphers require separate keys to encrypt and decrypt the message, and they are the most important component when establishing a secure session. What makes these algorithms work is that an attacker cannot decipher the message with the encryption key; he <em>must</em> have the decryption key. Therefore, the encryption key, also called the Public Key, can be freely traded between parties without posing a security risk, as long as the decryption key (a.k.a. the Private Key) is not revealed. The principle asymmetric ciphers employed by TLS are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)\">RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)</a> and DHE (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange\">Diffie–Hellman</a>).</p>\n<p>Now we can define “cipher suite.” A cipher suite contains:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A symmetric encryption algorithm (such as AES)</li>\n<li>An asymmetric encryption algorithm (such as RSA)</li>\n<li>A Message Authentication Code (MAC), used to authenticate messages</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Step 2: The server generates a public/private key pair and responds to the client with: the cipher suite it wants to use, the TLS version it wants to use, a digital certificate, the public key, and another string of random bytes (called the <em>server random</em>).</strong></p>\n<p>The digital certificate is supplied by the server’s domain name provider. The client will check with them and ensure that the server is the actual owner of the domain.</p>\n<p>After this message is sent, the client and server will use the highest TLS version and the most secure cipher suite available to both.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 3: The client generates another string of random bytes (called the <em>pre-master secret</em>), encrypts it with the server’s public key, and sends the result to the server.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Step 4: The server decrypts the message sent by the client with its private key. Now both the server and the client have the unencrypted pre-master secret.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Step 5: The server and the client use the pre-master secret, the client random and the server random to generate another key, called the <em>session key</em>. They should both generate the same key.</strong></p>\n<p>Keep in mind that the session key is different than the server’s public/private keys. The former is a key for a symmetric algorithm such as AES, whereas the public/private keys were either RSA or DHE.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 6: The server and client will exchanged messages encrypted with the session key to ensure that the handshake worked.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Step 7: If the handshake was successful, the client and server will use the session key for the remainder of session. The MAC is used in conjunction with the session key to authenticate messages.</strong></p>\n<p>Once a secure connection is established, there is no need to keep the private key, public key, or pre-master secret.</p>\n<p>And that’s it! Except for one small detail: this is how TLS works with RSA. With DHE, there are a couple changes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Along with the public key, the server sends a message encrypted with the private key to prove that the two keys are indeed pairs. The message contains a string known as the DH parameter.</li>\n<li>Instead of the client generating the pre-master secret randomly, both the server and client use the DH parameter to generate it.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Summarizing What You Just Read</h3>\n<p>This was a lot to take in. If there’s anything you derive from the preceding information it’s this:</p>\n<p><strong>We use an asymmetric encryption algorithm to exchange information that generates a symmetric encryption key.</strong></p>\n<p>The real genius lies in how the encryption algorithms work, so if you’re a sucker for math we highly recommend you checking them out.

We started with <a href=\"https://devsafehouse.medium.com/switches-and-routers-whats-the-difference-df2dedc24d86\">switches and routers</a> and moved onto a <a href=\"https://devsafehouse.medium.com/osi-model-and-tcp-ip-explained-with-example-88d99d2ce516\">bird’s eye view</a> of the entire network stack.</p>\n<p>In this article we will take a closer look at what is known as the Transport Layer (Layer 4) in the OSI model. This is the layer that segments, verifies and controls the flow of information between computers, and assigns various connections to ports. While Layer 4 is commonly associated with TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), there are other protocols that can occupy this spot. The second most common layer-4 protocol is UDP (User Datagram Protocol). In this article we will go over the similarities, differences and uses of these protocols.</p>\n<h3>What is TCP?</h3>\n<p>TCP is a protocol built atop IP that handles the segmentation, reassembly and verification of pieces of data sent between computers, known as packets. It is a connection-oriented protocol in that computers must acknowledge each other to be able to communicate.</p>\n<p>TCP’s strength is correctness; it extensively error-checks and verifies messages such that no info is lost. Furthermore, TCP sends data in a particular sequence. The result is that any data sent via TCP will be delivered in its intended format.</p>\n<p>Before sending and receiving data, TCP requires authentication for both computers in the form of a three-way handshake. The host establishing the connection sends a ‘SYN’ packet to the other host. The second host sends a ‘SYN-ACK’ packet to the first, and the first sends an ‘ACK’ to the second.</p>\n<h3>TCP Uses</h3>\n<p>TCP is the most common protocol on the internet, and for good reason. TCP is the correct choice whenever a high level of data precision is required. Some services that rely on TCP are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>HTTP/HTTPS (the protocol that delivers web pages)</li>\n<li>FTP (File Transfer Protocol)</li>\n<li>Email protocols (POP, IMAP, SMTP)</li>\n<li>Remote terminals (SSH, Telnet)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What is UDP?</h3>\n<p>UDP also sits atop IP and handles segmentation and reassembly of data sent over the internet, but in all other respects it is different.</p>\n<p>UDP is connectionless; computers do not have to agree to exchange data before any transfer occurs. Packets sent via UDP are not ordered; they are send in a continuous stream which may affect how the data appears once delivered. UDP does not have the extensive error checking of TCP. UDP does not guarantee the delivery of data. Finally, UDP does not offer flow control like TCP does.</p>\n<p>The major upside of UDP is its speed. UDP is a light-weight and fast protocol because it does not feature the safety checks of TCP, nor does it need to establish connections. UDP is preferable to TCP when time is more of a concern than accuracy.</p>\n<h3>UDP Uses</h3>\n<p>UDP is most commonly used for voice and video communication. These mediums are well suited for UDP because corrupting a millisecond of audio or a single frame of video will hardly ruin the entire communication.</p>\n<p>Another interesting use case for UDP is online video games. Communicating the states of hundreds of game objects in real time with 100% accuracy may be infeasible, so game developers sacrifice this accuracy to deliver this data on time as you play.</p>\n<p>Other services that use UDP:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>DNS (Domain Name Service): the protocol that allows domain names (www.example.com) to map to IP addresses</li>\n<li>NTP (Network Time Protocol): a protocol for clock synchronization</li>\n<li>VPN tunneling (encrypted communications between the VPN and the public internet)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>A Bit More About Layer 4</h3>\n<p>It’s important to remember that TCP and UDP occupy the same “spot” in the OSI model. As such they have access to the same set of ports. If one port is occupied by a TCP service, it cannot be used by a UDP service.</p>\n<p>Transport Layer Security (TLS) is often said to inhabit Layer 4 as it too handles the authentication of connection endpoints and verification of data, but would likely fit into the Presentation Layer (Layer 6) as it also handles the encryption of data. Furthermore, it is built on top of TCP and applications must provide their own implementation of TLS. For example, HTTPS is the same as HTTP but with TLS included. This is a topic we will cover in a future article.</p>\n<h4>SafeHouse</h4>\n<p>At SafeHouse, we make heavy use of TCP/TLS in our software to secure your private network.
