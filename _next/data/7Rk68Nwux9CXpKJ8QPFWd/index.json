We will analyze a message sent across the internet and witness its journey through all these layers.</p>\n<p><strong>OSI model</strong></p>\n<p>Let’s go over the OSI model first. The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model consists of seven “layers of the internet.” They are named:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1) Physical</li>\n<li>2) Datalink</li>\n<li>3) Network</li>\n<li>4) Transport</li>\n<li>5) Session</li>\n<li>6) Presentation</li>\n<li>7) Application</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Physical, Datalink, and Network layers we’ve talked about in our <a href=\"https://devsafehouse.medium.com/switches-and-routers-whats-the-difference-df2dedc24d86\">last article</a>, consisting of ethernet cables, MAC addresses, and IP addresses.</p>\n<p>The Transport layer most commonly uses the TCP and UDP protocols to manage the ports that computers use to connect with each other. TCP in particular provides error checking and authentication to ensure the data is correct (see our <a href=\"https://devsafehouse.medium.com/tcp-vs-udp-whats-the-difference-8ef9616fc14a\">next article</a> for details). The Session layer is responsible for maintaining the connection between computers. The Presentation layer is where you’ll see formatting of the information being communicated, such as file types and encryption. Finally the Application layer is for end-user software such as a web browsers, and it uses a wide variety of protocols including HTTP and FTP.</p>\n<p><strong>TCP/IP model: Special Case of the OSI Model</strong></p>\n<p>The TCP/IP model has the exact same layers for the first four layers; Physical, Datalink, Network, and Transport. But it combines layers 5, 6, and 7 into the Application Layer. This is because many things in Layer 5 and 6 were dealt with in layer 4 and 7, as technology progressed.</p>\n<p>In recent years, the TCP/IP model has become more popular, while the OSI model leaves its legacy as the application layer is still referred to as layer 7.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*ODVh96O1PtUdUbTw\"></figure><p><strong>Example</strong></p>\n<p>Let’s say we have a network setup exactly like in the picture above. Your computer is connected to a switch, then a router, another switch, then to a server. You want to access a website that is hosted on the server. In your browser, you type in the URL of the website and hit enter.</p>\n<p>Your message will be sent first to the DNS server within your network, in order to figure out what IP the URL is representing. Now that you know what IP the website server has you can send your GET request to display the website.</p>\n<p>As the contents of the GET request pass through the various layers, headers are added to the data which contain information useful to the server at delivery.</p>\n<p>The message is first encapsulated in an HTTPS header, containing information about the type of request. Then it is encapsulated in a Layer 4 (TCP) header, which contains the source and destination ports. Messages at Layer 4 are divided into segments. The message will then be encapsulated in a Layer 3 header, containing the source and destination IP addresses. The segments will henceforth be known as packets. The packets will be processed by Layer 2, which attaches both a head and a tail to the data. At this stage the packets are now called frames. Finally, the message is sent over ethernet cables (Layer 1 hardware) to the router.</p>\n<p>Upon arrival at the router, the router de-capsulates the message to figure out what IP to send it to. An ARP frame goes out to retrieve the MAC address of the destination IP. The router re-encapsulates the message with a Layer 2 head and tail. The second switch (in the server’s private network) receives and sends this message to the server.</p>\n<p>The server de-encapsulates every layer to open the HTTPS message. It now knows that you sent a GET request to be able to display the website. The server sends the contents of the webpage to you, repeating the process all over again.</p>\n<p><strong>Transport layer</strong></p>\n<p>To cover the transport layer in more detail, we’re going to talk about the two main protocols, TCP and UDP. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is the more reliable one incorporating confirmation of data being received. UDP(User Datagram Protocol) sends information without verification and hence is the faster one.</p>\n<p>In TCP, there is a three way handshake that a client makes with a server. A SYN packet sent by the client, followed by a SYN ACK packet sent by the server, then finally an ACK packet sent by the client. SYN means synchronization and ACK means acknowledgement.</p>\n<p>This handshake occurs so that the client and server can confirm whether messages are received and can make sure everything is reliably handled.</p>\n<p>In UDP, messages from the client are just thrown at the server without verification. This does make the process a lot faster, but some downsides are that packets can be lost in the transaction, or duplicates of messages can be received.

In the beginning stages of the development of the computer, the need arose for computers to be able to talk to each other. Two computers were connected by a wire, and gradually, multiple computers were connected by switches and routers.</p>\n<p>In this article, we will talk about Switches and Routers, how they work, and their differences.</p>\n<p>First, to understand the development of Switches, we will take a look at hubs.</p>\n<p><strong>Hubs, the outdated switches</strong></p>\n<p>Hubs are a predecessor of switches that became outdated for good reason. Let’s say we have a network of 4 computers that want to talk to each other. All 4 computers are connected to a hub via ethernet cables, forming a plus sign with the hub in the middle.</p>\n<p>When Computer 1 wants to talk to Computer 2, it sends out a message to the hub, which then sends this message out to the other 3 computers on the network. Then when Computer 2 responds, it sends its message to the hub, who broadcasts it to the other 3 computers again.</p>\n<p>The obvious problem here is that Computers 3 and 4 get to see the whole conversation that Computers 1 and 2 are having. Not only will it be annoying for people that don’t want to hear conversations not directed towards them, but also it makes it easier for hackers to listen in on any conversation as long as they are on the network.</p>\n<p><strong>Enter Switches</strong></p>\n<p>Switches allow two computers on a network to talk to each other privately. With the same example of four computers connected by a switch in the middle, Computer 1 sends a message through an ethernet cable to the switch, who then sends it only to Computer 2. Computer 2 responds back to the switch, who redirects the message back to Computer 1. This way, no one else on the network will receive the messages.</p>\n<p>Switches do this through the use of MAC addresses (Media Access Control). Each computer on the network has a MAC address that might look something like this: <em>00:1B:54:21:3A:A7</em>. The switch recognizes each computer by their MAC address, and is thus able to send messages to the correct computer.</p>\n<p>Like the hub, he switch is a device with a bunch of ethernet ports to which computers connect. The switch creates a CAM table that matches all of the connected devices to their corresponding physical ports. As long as a machine sends a message across the network through the switch, the switch will add its MAC address and physical port to the CAM table.</p>\n<p>A computer trying to talk to another computer does so through IP addresses. So how does the switch match the IP address to the MAC address? The answer is through ARP (Address Resolution Protocol). Computer 1 sends out a request to talk to Computer 2 by sending an IP address to the switch. The switch broadcasts the ARP frame to everyone, asking for “Who has this IP?”. Computer 2, who has that IP, will respond “Me, and this is my MAC address.” Now the switch will know Computer 2’s MAC and IP address. This process only needs to happen once.</p>\n<p><strong>Routers</strong></p>\n<p>A router’s job is to connect different networks to each other. Let’s say we have computers 1–4 connected by a switch on network 1, and computers 5–8 connected via a switch in the same way on network 2. The router would be sitting in the middle of these two networks, connecting to both switches via ethernet.</p>\n<p>When let’s say computer 1 wants to talk to computer 5, it will send a request to the switch, asking to send a message to the router’s IP address. Computer 1 automatically knows that Computer 5’s IP does not belong on the same network, and sends this request to the gateway, or router.</p>\n<p>It is able to do this through the configuration of the IP addresses. Let’s say computers 1–4 have IP’s in the range 10.1.1.0 to 10.1.1.225. This means that every computer on the network will have an IP that starts with 10.1.1. On Network 2, computers 5–8 have IP’s in the range 192.168.1.0–225, meaning that their IP’s all start with 192.168.1. When Computer 1 sends a request to talk to Computer 5, whose IP starts with 192.168.1, it knows that this computer does not belong on the same network, and will send the request directly to the router, who might have an IP of 10.1.1.1.</p>\n<p><strong>Example of message sent across a network</strong></p>\n<p>Computer 1 wants to talk to Computer 5. Computer 1 first sends an ARP frame to the switch asking for the IP of the router, 10.1.1.1. The switch broadcasts this message to all devices, and the router returns the message with its MAC address. Now computer 1 knows the router’s MAC address.</p>\n<p>Computer 1 now sends a packet to the router with the IP address of computer 5. The router sends an ARP frame to the switch on Network 2, who broadcasts it to find out what MAC address belongs to that IP. Computer 5 responds with its MAC address.</p>\n<p>Computer 1 now knows Computer 5’s IP and MAC address. It sends a packet to Computer 5 and Computer 5 responds back with a message.</p>\n<p><strong>The OSI Model and “Layers”</strong></p>\n<p>To end this article, let’s go over some terminology. The various devices and protocols that comprise what we know as the internet are often divided into seven “layers.”</p>\n<p>The first layer, known as the “Physical Layer,” comprises of the wires and other physical media through which bits of data are sent across the internet.</p>\n<p>The second layer, known as the “Data Link Layer,” handles the transfer of data between two directly connected devices, identified by their MAC addresses. In other words, the switches discussed in this article comprise this layer. Data processed by this layer is divided into <em>frames</em>, which was the word we used to describe ARP requests/responses.</p>\n<p>The third layer, known as the “Network Layer,” handles the transfer of data between networks.

In the beginning stages of the development of the computer, the need arose for computers to be able to talk to each other. Two computers were connected by a wire, and gradually, multiple computers were connected by switches and routers.</p>\n<p>In this article, we will talk about Switches and Routers, how they work, and their differences.</p>\n<p>First, to understand the development of Switches, we will take a look at hubs.</p>\n<p><strong>Hubs, the outdated switches</strong></p>\n<p>Hubs are a predecessor of switches that became outdated for good reason. Let’s say we have a network of 4 computers that want to talk to each other. All 4 computers are connected to a hub via ethernet cables, forming a plus sign with the hub in the middle.</p>\n<p>When Computer 1 wants to talk to Computer 2, it sends out a message to the hub, which then sends this message out to the other 3 computers on the network. Then when Computer 2 responds, it sends its message to the hub, who broadcasts it to the other 3 computers again.</p>\n<p>The obvious problem here is that Computers 3 and 4 get to see the whole conversation that Computers 1 and 2 are having. Not only will it be annoying for people that don’t want to hear conversations not directed towards them, but also it makes it easier for hackers to listen in on any conversation as long as they are on the network.</p>\n<p><strong>Enter Switches</strong></p>\n<p>Switches allow two computers on a network to talk to each other privately. With the same example of four computers connected by a switch in the middle, Computer 1 sends a message through an ethernet cable to the switch, who then sends it only to Computer 2. Computer 2 responds back to the switch, who redirects the message back to Computer 1. This way, no one else on the network will receive the messages.</p>\n<p>Switches do this through the use of MAC addresses (Media Access Control). Each computer on the network has a MAC address that might look something like this: <em>00:1B:54:21:3A:A7</em>. The switch recognizes each computer by their MAC address, and is thus able to send messages to the correct computer.</p>\n<p>Like the hub, he switch is a device with a bunch of ethernet ports to which computers connect. The switch creates a CAM table that matches all of the connected devices to their corresponding physical ports. As long as a machine sends a message across the network through the switch, the switch will add its MAC address and physical port to the CAM table.</p>\n<p>A computer trying to talk to another computer does so through IP addresses. So how does the switch match the IP address to the MAC address? The answer is through ARP (Address Resolution Protocol). Computer 1 sends out a request to talk to Computer 2 by sending an IP address to the switch. The switch broadcasts the ARP frame to everyone, asking for “Who has this IP?”. Computer 2, who has that IP, will respond “Me, and this is my MAC address.” Now the switch will know Computer 2’s MAC and IP address. This process only needs to happen once.</p>\n<p><strong>Routers</strong></p>\n<p>A router’s job is to connect different networks to each other. Let’s say we have computers 1–4 connected by a switch on network 1, and computers 5–8 connected via a switch in the same way on network 2. The router would be sitting in the middle of these two networks, connecting to both switches via ethernet.</p>\n<p>When let’s say computer 1 wants to talk to computer 5, it will send a request to the switch, asking to send a message to the router’s IP address. Computer 1 automatically knows that Computer 5’s IP does not belong on the same network, and sends this request to the gateway, or router.</p>\n<p>It is able to do this through the configuration of the IP addresses. Let’s say computers 1–4 have IP’s in the range 10.1.1.0 to 10.1.1.225. This means that every computer on the network will have an IP that starts with 10.1.1. On Network 2, computers 5–8 have IP’s in the range 192.168.1.0–225, meaning that their IP’s all start with 192.168.1. When Computer 1 sends a request to talk to Computer 5, whose IP starts with 192.168.1, it knows that this computer does not belong on the same network, and will send the request directly to the router, who might have an IP of 10.1.1.1.</p>\n<p><strong>Example of message sent across a network</strong></p>\n<p>Computer 1 wants to talk to Computer 5. Computer 1 first sends an ARP frame to the switch asking for the IP of the router, 10.1.1.1. The switch broadcasts this message to all devices, and the router returns the message with its MAC address. Now computer 1 knows the router’s MAC address.</p>\n<p>Computer 1 now sends a packet to the router with the IP address of computer 5. The router sends an ARP frame to the switch on Network 2, who broadcasts it to find out what MAC address belongs to that IP. Computer 5 responds with its MAC address.</p>\n<p>Computer 1 now knows Computer 5’s IP and MAC address. It sends a packet to Computer 5 and Computer 5 responds back with a message.</p>\n<p><strong>The OSI Model and “Layers”</strong></p>\n<p>To end this article, let’s go over some terminology. The various devices and protocols that comprise what we know as the internet are often divided into seven “layers.”</p>\n<p>The first layer, known as the “Physical Layer,” comprises of the wires and other physical media through which bits of data are sent across the internet.</p>\n<p>The second layer, known as the “Data Link Layer,” handles the transfer of data between two directly connected devices, identified by their MAC addresses. In other words, the switches discussed in this article comprise this layer. Data processed by this layer is divided into <em>frames</em>, which was the word we used to describe ARP requests/responses.</p>\n<p>The third layer, known as the “Network Layer,” handles the transfer of data between networks. Routers comprise this layer, and endpoints are identified by IP addresses instead of MAC addresses. Data processed through this layer is divided into <em>packets</em>.</p>\n<p>If this seems confusion, don’t worry! We will cover this in our next article.</p>\n<p><strong>Bonus: WAP, DNS, Layer 3 switches</strong></p>\n<p>Wireless Access Point: You can think of a wireless access point as a wireless hub. Messages sent from the access point is broadcasted to all devices connected to it. This is what Wi-fi is.</p>\n<p>DNS: DNS stands for domain name server. This can be a server on a network that contains information to match IP addresses to URLs. Computer 1 figures out who the DNS server is by sending an ARP frame to the switch, which broadcasts it, then the DNS server tells computer 1 the IP address of the URL it’s trying to connect to.</p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>Layer 1: Physical, ethernet cables, wires.</p>\n<p>Layer 2: Switches(connect computers), MAC addresses, messages sent are called frames.</p>\n<p>Layer 3: Routers(connect networks), IP addresses, messages sent are called packets.</p>\n<p>At Safehouse, we are trying to make networks more secure, read more at <a href=\"http://www.safehouse.dev/\">www.safehouse.dev</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=df2dedc24d86\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n","enclosure":{},"categories":["switch","cybersecurity","router","networking"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
