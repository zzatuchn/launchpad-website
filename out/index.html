The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model consists of seven layers of the internet: 1) Physical, 2) Datalink, 3) Network, 4) Transport, 5) Session, 6) Presentation, 7) Application. The Physical, Datalink, and Network layers we’ve already talked about, consisting of ethernet cables, MAC addresses, and IP addresses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Transport layer most commonly uses the TCP and UDP protocols to manage the ports that computers connect with each other through. The Session layer is responsible for maintaining the connection between computers. The Presentation layer is where you’ll see formatting of the information being communicated, such as file types and encryption. Finally the Application layer is for end-user software such as a browser, and it uses protocols including HTTP and FTP.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTCP/IP model\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe TCP/IP model has the exact same layers for the first four layers; Physical, Datalink, Network, and Transport. But it combines the layer 5, 6, and 7 into the Application layer. This is because many things in Layer 5 and 6 were dealt with in layer 4 and 7, as technology progressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn recent years, the TCP/IP model has become more popular, while the OSI model leaves its legacy as the application layer is still referred to as layer 7.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*ODVh96O1PtUdUbTw\"\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExample\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet’s say we have a network setup exactly like in the picture above. Your computer is connected to a switch, then a router, another switch, then to a server. You want to access a website that is hosted on the server. In your browser, you type in the URL of the website and hit enter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour message will be sent first to the DNS server within your network, in order to figure out what IP the URL is representing. Now that you know what IP the website server has you can send your GET request to display the website.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour message is encapsulated in an HTTPS header. Then it is encapsulated in a Layer 4 header(TCP), which contains the source and destination ports. Messages at layer 4 are called segments. It will then be encapsulated in a layer 3 header, containing the source and destination IP addresses, and becoming a packet. After, it will be encapsulated at layer 2, which actually has a header and a tail, becoming a frame. Finally it is sent over ethernet cables at layer 1 to the router.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpon arrival at the router, the router de-encapsulates the message to figure out what IP to send it to. Arp frame goes out to learn the MAC address of that IP. Router encapsulates the message with a layer 2 head and tail, and the second switch receives and sends this message to the server.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArriving at the server, the server de-encapsulates every layer to open the HTTPS message.

In the beginning stages of the development of the computer, the need arose for computers to be able to talk to each other. Two computers were connected by a wire, and gradually, multiple computers were connected by switches and routers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this article, we will talk about Switches and Routers, how they work, and their differences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, to understand the development of Switches, we will take a look at hubs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHubs, the outdated switches\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHubs are the old switches that became outdated for good reason. Let’s say we have a network of 4 computers that want to talk to each other. All 4 computers are connected to a hub via ethernet cables, forming a plus sign with the hub in the middle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen computer 1 wants to talk to computer 2, it sends out a message to the hub, who then sends this message out to the other 3 computers on the network. Then when computer 2 responds, it sends its message to the hub, who broadcasts it to the other 3 computers again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe obvious problem here is that computers 3 and 4 get to see the whole conversation that computers 1 and 2 are having. Not only will it be annoying for people that don’t want to hear conversations not directed towards them, but also it makes it easier for hackers to listen in on any conversation as long as they are on the network.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEnter Switches\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwitches allow two computers on a network to talk to each other privately. With the same example of four computers connected by a switch in the middle, computer 1 sends a message through an ethernet cable to the switch, who then sends it only to computer 2. Computer 2 responds back to the switch, who redirects the message back to computer 1. This way, no one else on the network will receive the messages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwitches do this through the use of MAC addresses(Media Access Control). Each computer on the network has a layer 2 identifier called a MAC address that might look something like this 00:1B:54:21:3A:A7. The switch recognizes each computer by their MAC address, and is thus able to send messages to the correct computer. Messages sent at this layer, layer 2, are called frames.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe switch is a device with a bunch of ethernet ports that computers connect to, which is layer 1, the physical. Inside the switch, it will create a CAM table that matches all of the connected devices to their corresponding physical ports. As long as a machine sends a message across the network through the switch, the switch will add its MAC address and physical port to the CAM table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA computer trying to talk to another computer does so through IP addresses. So how does the switch match the IP address to the MAC address? The answer is through ARP (Address resolution protocol). Computer 1 sends out a request to talk to computer 2 by sending an IP address to the switch. The switch broadcasts this ARP frame to everyone, asking for “Who has this IP?”. Computer 2, who has that IP, will respond “Me, and this is my MAC address.” Now the switch will know computer 2’s MAC and IP address. This process only needs to happen once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRouters\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA router’s job is to connect different networks to each other. Let’s say we have computers 1–4 connected by a switch on network 1, and computers 5–8 connected via a switch in the same way on network 2. The router would be sitting in the middle of these two networks, connecting to both switches via ethernet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen let’s say computer 1 wants to talk to computer 5, it will send a request to the switch, asking to send a message to the router’s IP address. Computer 1 automatically knows that computer 5’s IP does not belong on the same network, and sends this request to the gateway, or router.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is able to do this through the configuration of the IP addresses. Let’s say computers 1–4 have IP’s in the range 10.1.1.0 to 10.1.1.225. This means that every computer on the network will have an IP that starts with 10.1.1. On network 2, computers 5–8 have IP’s in the range 192.168.1.0–225, meaning that their IP’s all start with 192.168.1. When computer 1 sends a request to talk to computer 5, whose IP starts with 192.168.1, it knows that this computer does not belong on the same network, and will send the request directly to the router, who might have an IP of 10.1.1.1.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe router is a layer 3 device, meaning that it deals with IP addresses.

In the beginning stages of the development of the computer, the need arose for computers to be able to talk to each other. Two computers were connected by a wire, and gradually, multiple computers were connected by switches and routers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this article, we will talk about Switches and Routers, how they work, and their differences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, to understand the development of Switches, we will take a look at hubs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHubs, the outdated switches\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHubs are the old switches that became outdated for good reason. Let’s say we have a network of 4 computers that want to talk to each other. All 4 computers are connected to a hub via ethernet cables, forming a plus sign with the hub in the middle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen computer 1 wants to talk to computer 2, it sends out a message to the hub, who then sends this message out to the other 3 computers on the network. Then when computer 2 responds, it sends its message to the hub, who broadcasts it to the other 3 computers again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe obvious problem here is that computers 3 and 4 get to see the whole conversation that computers 1 and 2 are having. Not only will it be annoying for people that don’t want to hear conversations not directed towards them, but also it makes it easier for hackers to listen in on any conversation as long as they are on the network.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEnter Switches\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwitches allow two computers on a network to talk to each other privately. With the same example of four computers connected by a switch in the middle, computer 1 sends a message through an ethernet cable to the switch, who then sends it only to computer 2. Computer 2 responds back to the switch, who redirects the message back to computer 1. This way, no one else on the network will receive the messages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwitches do this through the use of MAC addresses(Media Access Control). Each computer on the network has a layer 2 identifier called a MAC address that might look something like this 00:1B:54:21:3A:A7. The switch recognizes each computer by their MAC address, and is thus able to send messages to the correct computer. Messages sent at this layer, layer 2, are called frames.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe switch is a device with a bunch of ethernet ports that computers connect to, which is layer 1, the physical. Inside the switch, it will create a CAM table that matches all of the connected devices to their corresponding physical ports. As long as a machine sends a message across the network through the switch, the switch will add its MAC address and physical port to the CAM table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA computer trying to talk to another computer does so through IP addresses. So how does the switch match the IP address to the MAC address? The answer is through ARP (Address resolution protocol). Computer 1 sends out a request to talk to computer 2 by sending an IP address to the switch. The switch broadcasts this ARP frame to everyone, asking for “Who has this IP?”. Computer 2, who has that IP, will respond “Me, and this is my MAC address.” Now the switch will know computer 2’s MAC and IP address. This process only needs to happen once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRouters\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA router’s job is to connect different networks to each other.
