who hasn’t been living under a rock has heard of Bitcoin. People have been debating for a long time about whether Bitcoin is “just a fad.” We don’t claim to be economists nor mind-readers. But what we will say is that many analysts are missing an important factor: that Bitcoin is just part of a larger revolution that hopes to \u003cem\u003ecompletely liberate the internet\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat are we talking about? In one word: \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003edecentralization\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhat is Decentralization?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy \u003cem\u003edecentralization, \u003c/em\u003ewe mean any situation in which the operation of a computer network is controlled not by a central authority, but by the community at large. Examples of decentralization are: Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, IPFS, and the BitTorrent protocol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe word \u003cem\u003edecentralized\u003c/em\u003e is often confused with the word \u003cem\u003edistributed. A d\u003c/em\u003eistributed system in one in which multiple computers share resources and computing power to accomplish a task. The key idea that separates \u003cem\u003edecentralized\u003c/em\u003e from \u003cem\u003edistributed\u003c/em\u003e is that decentralized systems are not controlled by a central authority (such as the owners of a server farm) and are instead \u003cem\u003eself-regulating. \u003c/em\u003eDistributed systems can be centralized, but decentralized systems are always distributed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eDecentralized\u003c/em\u003e is also confused with the term \u003cem\u003epeer-to-peer\u003c/em\u003e. \u003cem\u003ePeer-to-peer \u003c/em\u003e(P2P)\u003cem\u003e \u003c/em\u003esystems are distributed systems in which no node has more privilege than another. Networks usually must be peer-to-peer to be considered truly decentralized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDecentralized systems must contain a mechanism for determining the true state of the system, in case a malicious actor attempts to tamper with it. Bitcoin uses the blockchain data structure to achieve this; it is essentially a tamper-proof ledger and the persons who record transactions the quickest are assumed to know the true state of the system. The true state of the system can also be determined through voting and consensus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo why do we think decentralization is the future. In short, \u003cstrong\u003eit gives power to the people!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eHistory of Decentralization\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore we go into the benefits of decentralization, it would be helpful to go over some examples.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eThe Early Days\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1980, the decentralized discussion platform \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet\"\u003eUsenet\u003c/a\u003e was launched. Users could read and post messages to categories known as newsgroups. These newsgroups were hosted on a variety of servers, usually owned by internet service providers (ISPs). Usenet is a direct precursor to the internet forums we know today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany social apps (Mastodon, PeerTube, etc.) have been developed in a similar vein to Usenet, and together comprise an entire ecosystem of decentralized social apps known as the Fediverse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1999, the peer-to-peer music sharing platform Napster was released. Reaching its peak in 2001, it was faced with a number of lawsuits because it facilitated the sharing of pirated materials. In mid 2001, it was forced to shut down its entire network and has since been rebranded as a music store and a music streaming service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2001, the decentralized file sharing protocol known as \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent\"\u003eBitTorrent\u003c/a\u003e was released. When a file is added to the BitTorrent network, it is split into pieces and distributed across multiple computers on the network. A client wanting to download the file would retrieve all of the pieces and reassemble them. Like Napster, BitTorrent is infamous as a platform for sharing pirated media, but continues to survive for this day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe difference is that unlike Napster, the BitTorrent protocol is entirely decentralized and cannot be shut down by a single authority. To destroy BitTorrent would be to ban all BitTorrent clients available on the web, of which there are many. Contrast this to Napster, which had a single, proprietary client. If Napster was not a for-profit and made its client open-source, perhaps it would exist today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eBitcoin\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2008, a person or group of people known only by the pen name Satoshi Nakamoto released the \u003ca href=\"https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf\"\u003eoriginal paper for Bitcoin\u003c/a\u003e. In it they describe a digital currency in which transactions are recorded in a tamper-proof ledger known as a blockchain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone on the network has a copy of the blockchain. Like we discussed earlier, the “correct” version of the ledger belongs to the user that can record and verify transactions the fastest. This process is called \u003cem\u003emining. \u003c/em\u003eMiners are rewarded in Bitcoin; this is how Bitcoin is introduced into the economy. Every 210,000, the reward for mining is cut in half, so there is technically a finite supply of Bitcoin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBitcoin is what really pushed decentralization into the mainstream. There is an estimated \u003cstrong\u003e200 million\u003c/strong\u003e Bitcoin wallets in existence. As of writing this article, a single Bitcoin costs about $32,000. Special computer parts have been developed for the purpose of mining.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eEthereum\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/\"\u003eEthereum\u003c/a\u003e is the most popular cryptocurrency behind Bitcoin, but what it offers is much more than a digital currency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoing live in 2015, Ethereum introduced an innovation that elevated crypto to the realm of traditional finance: \u003cem\u003esmart contracts\u003c/em\u003e. These contracts were self-executing code that, like normal transactions, were recorded on chain and thus were binding and tamper-proof.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat Ethereum introduced was the ability express concepts like loans and interest in the form of its smart contracts, making it as powerful as traditional currency. All of the instruments of traditional finance could be reinvented, forming an ecosystem of DeFi (Decentralized Finance) applications. Smart contracts could also be used to write entire applications on chain, known as Dapps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, Ethereum introduced Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), which are individual units of data stored on chain, used to certify the uniqueness of a digital asset (photos, music, video game items, etc.). NFT’s have most famously been used for selling original pieces of digital art. In 2020, a series of works by the artist Mike Winkelmann called “Everyday — The First 500 Days,” was \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everydays:_the_First_5000_Days\"\u003eauctioned in the form of an NFT for \u003cstrong\u003e69 million dollars\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eDecentralized Storage (IPFS, Storj, FileCoin, etc.)\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you follow tech news, you’ve probably read about a government or mega-corporation whose records were leaked by hackers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDecentralized storage protocols provide a number of security benefits over traditional cloud storage providers. These protocols tend to encrypt, split up and distribute files in a similar manner to BitTorrent, so workstations hosting your files are unable to view them. They are also \u003cstrong\u003efault-tolerant\u003c/strong\u003e in that a single compromised node does not bring down the entire system. Finally, these protocols store files \u003cstrong\u003eredundantly\u003c/strong\u003e such that lost data can be easily recovered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://ipfs.io/\"\u003eIPFS\u003c/a\u003e is special in that it is not just a storage system but an entirely decentralized version of the web. IPFS is able to host web pages that can be accessed through your browser. IPFS already hosts search engines, messaging platforms, crypto wallets, databases, and more….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eThe Case for Decentralization\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe beauty of decentralization is that means independence from Big Tech, governments and financial institutions. It means the ability to communicate and exchange assets without any middlemen. It means the ability to speak freely without fear of censorship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet’s start with the issue of censorship. Consider a person living under a repressive regime who wants to speak out against the government. If he uses a state-approved social media app, his communications will be monitored and censored, and he will possibly face legal consequences. What if he uses a decentralized social app like \u003ca href=\"https://joinmastodon.org/\"\u003eMastodon\u003c/a\u003e? His posts won’t be in the hands of the government, but in a server belonging to a gracious individual. What if the government finds who is operating the server and forces it to shut down? He can use a serverless, blockchain-based app instead of a federated one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe point is that decentralization makes the internet \u003cem\u003eun-censorable\u003c/em\u003e. There are plenty of “alternative” social media apps (Parler, Gab, etc.) that claim to stand for free speech, but can they really be trusted if they aren’t decentralized? Keep in mind that it’s not just the social media company that controls what appears on the app; it’s also the server owner, the government, and the app store operator in the case of mobile apps. The iPhone version of \u003ca href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/parler-returns-to-apple-app-store-with-new-hate-speech-censorship/ar-BB1gPCDT\"\u003eParler now censors hate speech\u003c/a\u003e so it can appear on Apple’s App Store, for example. (We are not condoning the use of hate speech. We are simply stating that no centralized app can be trusted to protect it, along with more benign speech.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis brings us to the biggest controversy surrounding decentralized networks: what is there to prevent illegal content from being uploaded? In the case of federated social media apps, the server owners are in charge of moderation, but what about serverless models like \u003ca href=\"https://ipfs.io/\"\u003eIPFS\u003c/a\u003e? The truth is that there is no easy answer. Consensus can be used to determine who is allowed to post, but if existing social media is anything to go by, “upvote” systems can be abused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile illegal content is a legitimate concern, we personally don’t see this as a reason to shun decentralization entirely. If worse comes to worst (keep in mind we’re talking about very new technology), the centralized and decentralized web will coexist in a similar fashion to the “surface” web and the “dark” web. But we don’t believe that this will happen. A more likely scenario is that server-based protocols will simply overtake serverless ones in popularity. Just like the “normal” web, there will be sanitized and un-sanitized places to accommodate all kinds of users.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet’s move onto cryptocurrency. Crypto has essentially ushered in a new economy free from the influence of banks and financial regulations. Middle-men have been completely cut out of the equation and the money supply is controlled by a fixed algorithm. The result is the pinnacle of free trade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy is this a good thing? It lowers the barrier of entry into finance. It can be used to \u003ca href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/iran-uses-crypto-mining-lessen-impact-sanctions-study-finds-2021-05-21/\"\u003ebypass economic sanctions\u003c/a\u003e. It offers an alternative currency for countries suffering inflation. There are lower transaction costs. A limited money supply means it can’t be devalued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, there are many concerns surrounding crypto, some more legitimate than others. \u003ca href=\"https://bariweiss.substack.com/p/the-case-against-bitcoin\"\u003eSkeptics\u003c/a\u003e have pointed out crypto’s volatility, the environmental effects of mining, the prevalence of scams and criminal activity, the fact that private keys can still be stolen, the fact the governments are already cracking down on it….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe won’t go over all of these issues right now (perhaps in another article). We admit that crypto in its current state is in need of improvement. But there is no reason to assume that none of these holes will be patched up. \u003ca href=\"https://minaprotocol.com/about\"\u003eBlockchains are already being developed\u003c/a\u003e to reduce energy consumption and improve security and scalability. Because of decentralization’s rise in popularity, there’s no reason to believe that the cryptocurrencies of tomorrow will be identical to Bitcoin or Ethereum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eConclusion\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’ve discussed two major use cases for decentralization in the section above, but the possibilities are truly endless. There is decentralized voting, gaming, gambling, databases, etc. etc., all free from government and corporate oversight for the most part. Decentralization is a way to bypass the various inconveniences and restrictions that limit our freedom and keep us from interacting directly. We will go into even more detail on decentralization in future articles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike we said at the beginning of the article, we are not economists.

People have been debating for a long time about whether Bitcoin is “just a fad.” We don’t claim to be economists nor mind-readers. But what we will say is that many analysts are missing an important factor: that Bitcoin is just part of a larger revolution that hopes to \u003cem\u003ecompletely liberate the internet\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat are we talking about? In one word: \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003edecentralization\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhat is Decentralization?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy \u003cem\u003edecentralization, \u003c/em\u003ewe mean any situation in which the operation of a computer network is controlled not by a central authority, but by the community at large. Examples of decentralization are: Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, IPFS, and the BitTorrent protocol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe word \u003cem\u003edecentralized\u003c/em\u003e is often confused with the word \u003cem\u003edistributed. A d\u003c/em\u003eistributed system in one in which multiple computers share resources and computing power to accomplish a task. The key idea that separates \u003cem\u003edecentralized\u003c/em\u003e from \u003cem\u003edistributed\u003c/em\u003e is that decentralized systems are not controlled by a central authority (such as the owners of a server farm) and are instead \u003cem\u003eself-regulating. \u003c/em\u003eDistributed systems can be centralized, but decentralized systems are always distributed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eDecentralized\u003c/em\u003e is also confused with the term \u003cem\u003epeer-to-peer\u003c/em\u003e. \u003cem\u003ePeer-to-peer \u003c/em\u003e(P2P)\u003cem\u003e \u003c/em\u003esystems are distributed systems in which no node has more privilege than another. Networks usually must be peer-to-peer to be considered truly decentralized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDecentralized systems must contain a mechanism for determining the true state of the system, in case a malicious actor attempts to tamper with it. Bitcoin uses the blockchain data structure to achieve this; it is essentially a tamper-proof ledger and the persons who record transactions the quickest are assumed to know the true state of the system. The true state of the system can also be determined through voting and consensus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo why do we think decentralization is the future. In short, \u003cstrong\u003eit gives power to the people!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eHistory of Decentralization\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore we go into the benefits of decentralization, it would be helpful to go over some examples.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eThe Early Days\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1980, the decentralized discussion platform \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet\"\u003eUsenet\u003c/a\u003e was launched. Users could read and post messages to categories known as newsgroups. These newsgroups were hosted on a variety of servers, usually owned by internet service providers (ISPs). Usenet is a direct precursor to the internet forums we know today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany social apps (Mastodon, PeerTube, etc.) have been developed in a similar vein to Usenet, and together comprise an entire ecosystem of decentralized social apps known as the Fediverse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1999, the peer-to-peer music sharing platform Napster was released. Reaching its peak in 2001, it was faced with a number of lawsuits because it facilitated the sharing of pirated materials. In mid 2001, it was forced to shut down its entire network and has since been rebranded as a music store and a music streaming service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2001, the decentralized file sharing protocol known as \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent\"\u003eBitTorrent\u003c/a\u003e was released. When a file is added to the BitTorrent network, it is split into pieces and distributed across multiple computers on the network. A client wanting to download the file would retrieve all of the pieces and reassemble them. Like Napster, BitTorrent is infamous as a platform for sharing pirated media, but continues to survive for this day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe difference is that unlike Napster, the BitTorrent protocol is entirely decentralized and cannot be shut down by a single authority. To destroy BitTorrent would be to ban all BitTorrent clients available on the web, of which there are many. Contrast this to Napster, which had a single, proprietary client. If Napster was not a for-profit and made its client open-source, perhaps it would exist today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eBitcoin\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2008, a person or group of people known only by the pen name Satoshi Nakamoto released the \u003ca href=\"https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf\"\u003eoriginal paper for Bitcoin\u003c/a\u003e. In it they describe a digital currency in which transactions are recorded in a tamper-proof ledger known as a blockchain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone on the network has a copy of the blockchain. Like we discussed earlier, the “correct” version of the ledger belongs to the user that can record and verify transactions the fastest. This process is called \u003cem\u003emining. \u003c/em\u003eMiners are rewarded in Bitcoin; this is how Bitcoin is introduced into the economy. Every 210,000, the reward for mining is cut in half, so there is technically a finite supply of Bitcoin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBitcoin is what really pushed decentralization into the mainstream. There is an estimated \u003cstrong\u003e200 million\u003c/strong\u003e Bitcoin wallets in existence. As of writing this article, a single Bitcoin costs about $32,000. Special computer parts have been developed for the purpose of mining.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eEthereum\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/\"\u003eEthereum\u003c/a\u003e is the most popular cryptocurrency behind Bitcoin, but what it offers is much more than a digital currency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoing live in 2015, Ethereum introduced an innovation that elevated crypto to the realm of traditional finance: \u003cem\u003esmart contracts\u003c/em\u003e. These contracts were self-executing code that, like normal transactions, were recorded on chain and thus were binding and tamper-proof.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat Ethereum introduced was the ability express concepts like loans and interest in the form of its smart contracts, making it as powerful as traditional currency. All of the instruments of traditional finance could be reinvented, forming an ecosystem of DeFi (Decentralized Finance) applications. Smart contracts could also be used to write entire applications on chain, known as Dapps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, Ethereum introduced Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), which are individual units of data stored on chain, used to certify the uniqueness of a digital asset (photos, music, video game items, etc.). NFT’s have most famously been used for selling original pieces of digital art. In 2020, a series of works by the artist Mike Winkelmann called “Everyday — The First 500 Days,” was \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everydays:_the_First_5000_Days\"\u003eauctioned in the form of an NFT for \u003cstrong\u003e69 million dollars\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eDecentralized Storage (IPFS, Storj, FileCoin, etc.)\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you follow tech news, you’ve probably read about a government or mega-corporation whose records were leaked by hackers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDecentralized storage protocols provide a number of security benefits over traditional cloud storage providers. These protocols tend to encrypt, split up and distribute files in a similar manner to BitTorrent, so workstations hosting your files are unable to view them. They are also \u003cstrong\u003efault-tolerant\u003c/strong\u003e in that a single compromised node does not bring down the entire system. Finally, these protocols store files \u003cstrong\u003eredundantly\u003c/strong\u003e such that lost data can be easily recovered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://ipfs.io/\"\u003eIPFS\u003c/a\u003e is special in that it is not just a storage system but an entirely decentralized version of the web. IPFS is able to host web pages that can be accessed through your browser. IPFS already hosts search engines, messaging platforms, crypto wallets, databases, and more….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eThe Case for Decentralization\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe beauty of decentralization is that means independence from Big Tech, governments and financial institutions. It means the ability to communicate and exchange assets without any middlemen. It means the ability to speak freely without fear of censorship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet’s start with the issue of censorship. Consider a person living under a repressive regime who wants to speak out against the government. If he uses a state-approved social media app, his communications will be monitored and censored, and he will possibly face legal consequences. What if he uses a decentralized social app like \u003ca href=\"https://joinmastodon.org/\"\u003eMastodon\u003c/a\u003e? His posts won’t be in the hands of the government, but in a server belonging to a gracious individual. What if the government finds who is operating the server and forces it to shut down? He can use a serverless, blockchain-based app instead of a federated one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe point is that decentralization makes the internet \u003cem\u003eun-censorable\u003c/em\u003e. There are plenty of “alternative” social media apps (Parler, Gab, etc.) that claim to stand for free speech, but can they really be trusted if they aren’t decentralized? Keep in mind that it’s not just the social media company that controls what appears on the app; it’s also the server owner, the government, and the app store operator in the case of mobile apps. The iPhone version of \u003ca href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/parler-returns-to-apple-app-store-with-new-hate-speech-censorship/ar-BB1gPCDT\"\u003eParler now censors hate speech\u003c/a\u003e so it can appear on Apple’s App Store, for example. (We are not condoning the use of hate speech. We are simply stating that no centralized app can be trusted to protect it, along with more benign speech.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis brings us to the biggest controversy surrounding decentralized networks: what is there to prevent illegal content from being uploaded? In the case of federated social media apps, the server owners are in charge of moderation, but what about serverless models like \u003ca href=\"https://ipfs.io/\"\u003eIPFS\u003c/a\u003e? The truth is that there is no easy answer. Consensus can be used to determine who is allowed to post, but if existing social media is anything to go by, “upvote” systems can be abused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile illegal content is a legitimate concern, we personally don’t see this as a reason to shun decentralization entirely. If worse comes to worst (keep in mind we’re talking about very new technology), the centralized and decentralized web will coexist in a similar fashion to the “surface” web and the “dark” web. But we don’t believe that this will happen. A more likely scenario is that server-based protocols will simply overtake serverless ones in popularity. Just like the “normal” web, there will be sanitized and un-sanitized places to accommodate all kinds of users.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet’s move onto cryptocurrency. Crypto has essentially ushered in a new economy free from the influence of banks and financial regulations. Middle-men have been completely cut out of the equation and the money supply is controlled by a fixed algorithm. The result is the pinnacle of free trade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy is this a good thing? It lowers the barrier of entry into finance. It can be used to \u003ca href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/iran-uses-crypto-mining-lessen-impact-sanctions-study-finds-2021-05-21/\"\u003ebypass economic sanctions\u003c/a\u003e. It offers an alternative currency for countries suffering inflation. There are lower transaction costs. A limited money supply means it can’t be devalued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, there are many concerns surrounding crypto, some more legitimate than others. \u003ca href=\"https://bariweiss.substack.com/p/the-case-against-bitcoin\"\u003eSkeptics\u003c/a\u003e have pointed out crypto’s volatility, the environmental effects of mining, the prevalence of scams and criminal activity, the fact that private keys can still be stolen, the fact the governments are already cracking down on it….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe won’t go over all of these issues right now (perhaps in another article). We admit that crypto in its current state is in need of improvement. But there is no reason to assume that none of these holes will be patched up. \u003ca href=\"https://minaprotocol.com/about\"\u003eBlockchains are already being developed\u003c/a\u003e to reduce energy consumption and improve security and scalability. Because of decentralization’s rise in popularity, there’s no reason to believe that the cryptocurrencies of tomorrow will be identical to Bitcoin or Ethereum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eConclusion\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’ve discussed two major use cases for decentralization in the section above, but the possibilities are truly endless. There is decentralized voting, gaming, gambling, databases, etc. etc., all free from government and corporate oversight for the most part. Decentralization is a way to bypass the various inconveniences and restrictions that limit our freedom and keep us from interacting directly. We will go into even more detail on decentralization in future articles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike we said at the beginning of the article, we are not economists. We’re not here to tell you that decentralized software will make you a millionaire (although we have no obvious reason to believe otherwise).

We’re going to take a deep dive into how this algorithm works. Modern cryptographic algorithms are by no means trivial; they use concepts from advanced mathematics to achieve a high level of security. But we don’t expect you to be a mathematician.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile there are many articles about AES, most of them are either too technical or leave out important information. With this article we hope to strike the perfect balance between comprehensiveness and accessibility. However, we must admit that this article will require some level of comfort with math, as mathematical concepts are introduced here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt must be stated that you should not try to implement AES by yourself in a production application, or risk a \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack\"\u003eside channel attack\u003c/a\u003e.

The actual name of the algorithm is \u003cem\u003eRijndael\u003c/em\u003e, and it was selected by the NIST over a number of algorithms to replace the former standard, known as DES (Data Encryption Standard). Rijndael was approved by the NIST in 2001 and adopted by the US government in 2002. It remains the standard cipher used by the US government and institutions across the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAES is a \u003cem\u003esymmetric cipher\u003c/em\u003e, which means that a single key is used to encrypt \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e decrypt the same data. AES can be performed with the following key sizes: \u003cstrong\u003e128 bits, 196 bits and 256 bits\u003c/strong\u003e. Generally, increasing the key size also increases the level of security. Rijndael works for any key size that is a multiple of 32 bits, but the NIST chose specific sizes (and other parameters) that balance performance and security.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is also a \u003cem\u003eblock cipher\u003c/em\u003e, meaning that the data is divided into blocks before encryption. AES divides plaintext into blocks of 16 bytes (128 bits).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eAlgorithm Overview\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gist of AES is this: we arrange each block of the plaintext into a 4x4 matrix and repeatedly perform a set of operations on it. We call each iteration a \u003cem\u003eround\u003c/em\u003e, and we perform \u003cstrong\u003e10, 12 or 14 rounds\u003c/strong\u003e depending on the key length (this is another parameter chosen by NIST):\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e10 rounds for a 128-bit key\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e12 rounds for a 196-bit key\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e14 rounds for a 256 bit key\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor each round, we generate a \u003cem\u003eround key \u003c/em\u003efrom the main key using the \u003cem\u003eRijndael Key Schedule\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are four operations on the 4x4 matrix that we will define:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003esubBytes()\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eshiftRows()\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003emixColumns()\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eaddRoundKey()\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot every round of operations is the same; for the first round, we only add the round key, and for the last round we omit the mixColumns() step.

We told you we would explain AES in detail and we weren’t lying. Luckily, we believe that the concepts in this section can be understood with only high-school level math and basic programming experience. Don’t let the fancy words throw you off!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet’s introduce a concept in abstract algebra called a \u003cem\u003eGalois field\u003c/em\u003e or \u003cem\u003efinite field\u003c/em\u003e. A \u003cem\u003efield\u003c/em\u003e is a set (meaning a collection of objects) with operations that act on the set and behave similarly to addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. In other words, the operations satisfy a number of properties that also hold true for addition/subtraction/multiplication/division over the rational numbers. In fact, the rational and real numbers with these four operations qualify as a field. The \u003cem\u003efinite\u003c/em\u003e qualifier just means that the set has a finite number of elements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe won’t go into the specific definition of a field. Just think of it as a set of numbers where addition, subtraction, multiplication and division are redefined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAES uses a specific Galois field, which we will call \u003cem\u003eRijndael’s finite field\u003c/em\u003e, to perform many essential operations. In particular, it uses GF(2⁸) with irreducible polynomial \u003cem\u003ex\u003c/em\u003e⁸ +\u003cem\u003e x\u003c/em\u003e⁴ + \u003cem\u003ex\u003c/em\u003e³ + \u003cem\u003ex\u003c/em\u003e + 1. You’ll understand what this means in a bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Galois field GF(\u003cem\u003epⁿ\u003c/em\u003e), where \u003cem\u003ep\u003c/em\u003e is prime and \u003cem\u003en\u003c/em\u003e is a positive integer, denotes the field with \u003cem\u003epⁿ \u003c/em\u003eelements\u003cem\u003e. \u003c/em\u003eFor example, the field GF(8) (or GF(2³)) contains all integers from 0 to 7. An important property of Galois fields is that the elements of the field GF(\u003cem\u003epⁿ\u003c/em\u003e) are \u003cstrong\u003eall polynomials of degree less than n with non-negative coefficients, evaluated at p\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e. p\u003c/em\u003e is called the \u003cem\u003echaracteristic\u003c/em\u003e of the field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet’s look at GF(8), or GF(2³), again. GF(2³) contains {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, which can be equivalently represented as {0, 1, 2, 2 + 1, 2², 2²+ 1, 2²+ 2, 2²+ 2 + 1}, or {0, 1, \u003cem\u003ex\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003ex\u003c/em\u003e+ 1, \u003cem\u003ex\u003c/em\u003e², \u003cem\u003ex\u003c/em\u003e² + 1, \u003cem\u003ex\u003c/em\u003e² + \u003cem\u003ex\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003ex\u003c/em\u003e² + \u003cem\u003ex\u003c/em\u003e+ 1} where \u003cem\u003ex\u003c/em\u003e = 2.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith this notation out of the way, we can now explain how addition/subtraction/multiplication/division works with Galois fields.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAddition/Subtraction\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuppose we want to add elements \u003cem\u003ea\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eb\u003c/em\u003e of GF(\u003cem\u003epⁿ\u003c/em\u003e). First, convert them to their polynomial forms, that is, write them as sums of powers of \u003cem\u003ep\u003c/em\u003e. Then we add the polynomials together, but with a caveat: for each coefficient \u003cem\u003ea_k\u003c/em\u003e in \u003cem\u003ea(p)\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eb_k\u003c/em\u003e in \u003cem\u003eb(p)\u003c/em\u003e, the resulting coefficient \u003cem\u003ec_k \u003c/em\u003eis equal to \u003cem\u003ea_k\u003c/em\u003e + \u003cem\u003eb_k\u003c/em\u003e mod \u003cem\u003ep\u003c/em\u003e. For subtraction, the formula is \u003cem\u003ec_k\u003c/em\u003e = \u003cem\u003ea_k\u003c/em\u003e — \u003cem\u003eb_k\u003c/em\u003e mod \u003cem\u003ep\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe apologize for Medium’s lack of support for mathematical expressions.

It is also resistant to \u003cstrong\u003edifferential cryptoanalysis\u003c/strong\u003e in that there seems to be no correlation between how the input changes and how the output changes.

AES can be performed with the following key sizes: \u003cstrong\u003e128 bits, 196 bits and 256 bits\u003c/strong\u003e. Generally, increasing the key size also increases the level of security.

We told you we would explain AES in detail and we weren’t lying. Luckily, we believe that the concepts in this section can be understood with only high-school level math and basic programming experience. Don’t let the fancy words throw you off!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet’s introduce a concept in abstract algebra called a \u003cem\u003eGalois field\u003c/em\u003e or \u003cem\u003efinite field\u003c/em\u003e. A \u003cem\u003efield\u003c/em\u003e is a set (meaning a collection of objects) with operations that act on the set and behave similarly to addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. In other words, the operations satisfy a number of properties that also hold true for addition/subtraction/multiplication/division over the rational numbers. In fact, the rational and real numbers with these four operations qualify as a field. The \u003cem\u003efinite\u003c/em\u003e qualifier just means that the set has a finite number of elements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe won’t go into the specific definition of a field. Just think of it as a set of numbers where addition, subtraction, multiplication and division are redefined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAES uses a specific Galois field, which we will call \u003cem\u003eRijndael’s finite field\u003c/em\u003e, to perform many essential operations. In particular, it uses GF(2⁸) with irreducible polynomial \u003cem\u003ex\u003c/em\u003e⁸ +\u003cem\u003e x\u003c/em\u003e⁴ + \u003cem\u003ex\u003c/em\u003e³ + \u003cem\u003ex\u003c/em\u003e + 1. You’ll understand what this means in a bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Galois field GF(\u003cem\u003epⁿ\u003c/em\u003e), where \u003cem\u003ep\u003c/em\u003e is prime and \u003cem\u003en\u003c/em\u003e is a positive integer, denotes the field with \u003cem\u003epⁿ \u003c/em\u003eelements\u003cem\u003e. \u003c/em\u003eFor example, the field GF(8) (or GF(2³)) contains all integers from 0 to 7. An important property of Galois fields is that the elements of the field GF(\u003cem\u003epⁿ\u003c/em\u003e) are \u003cstrong\u003eall polynomials of degree less than n with non-negative coefficients, evaluated at p\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e. p\u003c/em\u003e is called the \u003cem\u003echaracteristic\u003c/em\u003e of the field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet’s look at GF(8), or GF(2³), again. GF(2³) contains {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, which can be equivalently represented as {0, 1, 2, 2 + 1, 2², 2²+ 1, 2²+ 2, 2²+ 2 + 1}, or {0, 1, \u003cem\u003ex\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003ex\u003c/em\u003e+ 1, \u003cem\u003ex\u003c/em\u003e², \u003cem\u003ex\u003c/em\u003e² + 1, \u003cem\u003ex\u003c/em\u003e² + \u003cem\u003ex\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003ex\u003c/em\u003e² + \u003cem\u003ex\u003c/em\u003e+ 1} where \u003cem\u003ex\u003c/em\u003e = 2.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith this notation out of the way, we can now explain how addition/subtraction/multiplication/division works with Galois fields.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAddition/Subtraction\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuppose we want to add elements \u003cem\u003ea\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eb\u003c/em\u003e of GF(\u003cem\u003epⁿ\u003c/em\u003e). First, convert them to their polynomial forms, that is, write them as sums of powers of \u003cem\u003ep\u003c/em\u003e. Then we add the polynomials together, but with a caveat: for each coefficient \u003cem\u003ea_k\u003c/em\u003e in \u003cem\u003ea(p)\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eb_k\u003c/em\u003e in \u003cem\u003eb(p)\u003c/em\u003e, the resulting coefficient \u003cem\u003ec_k \u003c/em\u003eis equal to \u003cem\u003ea_k\u003c/em\u003e + \u003cem\u003eb_k\u003c/em\u003e mod \u003cem\u003ep\u003c/em\u003e. For subtraction, the formula is \u003cem\u003ec_k\u003c/em\u003e = \u003cem\u003ea_k\u003c/em\u003e — \u003cem\u003eb_k\u003c/em\u003e mod \u003cem\u003ep\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe apologize for Medium’s lack of support for mathematical expressions.

It is resistant to \u003cstrong\u003elinear cryptoanalysis\u003c/strong\u003e in that it is hard to approximate with a linear transformation. It is also resistant to \u003cstrong\u003edifferential cryptoanalysis\u003c/strong\u003e in that there seems to be no correlation between how the input changes and how the output changes. Finally, sbox() is special in that there are no \u003cstrong\u003efixed points\u003c/strong\u003e, i.e. there are no situations where the input equals the output.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe key expansion algorithm works mainly on 32-bit words instead of bytes. For the future, we will define \u003cstrong\u003esubWord() \u003c/strong\u003eas the application of sbox() on each byte of a word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eThe Key Expansion Algorithm\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnto the actual key-generation algorithm. Let’s define some constants before we take a look at the steps:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLet K[0] thru K[N-1] represent the 32-bit words of the original key.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLet N equal the length of the original key in 32-bit words \u003cstrong\u003e(4, 6, or 8 for a 128, 192 or 256-bit key respectively).\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLet R equal the number of rounds \u003cstrong\u003e(10, 12, or 15 for a 128, 192 or 256-bit key respectively).\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLet W[0] thru W[4R-1] represent the 32-bit words comprising all of the round keys. Let’s call this the expanded key.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe key expansion algorithm iterates through all of the 32-bit words W[0] thru W[4R-1]. When we want a specific round key, we combine the four words (128 bits) from of the expanded key corresponding to that round. For example, the Round 3 Key comprises of W[8] thru W[11].\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe algorithm goes like this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003efor (i from 0 to 4R - 1) {\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e  //The first words (W[0] thru W[N-1]) are equal to the words of the original key.\u003cbr\u003e  //For a 128-bit key, this means that the first round key is equal to the original key.\u003cbr\u003e  if (0 \u0026lt; i \u0026lt; N) W[i] = K[i];\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e  //Perform operations on the last word of each N-length cycle before XOR-ing.\u003cbr\u003e  else if (i \u0026gt;= N and i == 0 mod N)\u003cbr\u003e    W[i] = W[i-N] \u003cstrong\u003e⊕ \u003c/strong\u003esubWord(rotate(W[i-1])) \u003cstrong\u003e⊕ \u003c/strong\u003ercon(i/N);\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e  //For a 256-bit key length only.\u003cbr\u003e  else if (i \u0026gt;= N and N == 8 and i == 4 mod N)\u003cbr\u003e    W[i] = W[i-N] \u003cstrong\u003e⊕ \u003c/strong\u003esubWord(W[i-1])\u003cstrong\u003e;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e  //Typical case\u003cbr\u003e  else W[i] = W[i-N] \u003cstrong\u003e⊕ \u003c/strong\u003eW[i-1];\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e}\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gist of the algorithm is this: generally, each word is the previous word XOR’ed with the word N places behind it.

Many common internet-facing applications secure data before it’s sent out into the world. But how? With an ingenious protocol known as TLS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhat is TLS?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the olden days of the internet, communication was completely unencrypted. This meant that eavesdroppers could potentially see all of the data sent over the internet. People had to be very careful when sending sensitive information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis problem was recognized as early as 1994, so the SSL (Secure Socket Layer) protocol was developed. SSL encrypts data at one endpoint and decrypts it at the other, such that data passed between computers was completely unintelligible. Keep in mind that this protocol does not protect data sitting on your computer (“at rest”); it only protects data in transit when two computers connect to each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTLS (Transport Layer Security) is a similar protocol to SSL and shares the same purpose. The first version was developed in 1999 and based on SSL 3.0. When SSL 3.0 was found to be insecure, it was completely replaced by TLS. TLS is used for web browsing, but can be used for a variety of services. Today, TLS 1.3 is the latest version of TLS and earlier versions should be avoided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou may have noticed when browsing the web that some URLs start with “http” and others with “https.” HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, and it is the protocol that retrieves HTML and other media to be displayed by your web browser. HTTPS is a version of HTTP with integrated TLS/SSL. In other words, accessing an “https” website means that your communications with the server are encrypted. It’s recommended that every website switch to HTTPS by purchasing an SSL certificate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eHow Does TLS Work\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first question one might ask about encrypted communication is “how do both parties know how to decrypt the messages? Surely they can’t just send the key over the web!” In fact, they can, and we will explain how step by step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuppose you are a web browser and you want to connect to a website’s host. The browser will conduct a conversation with the server to establish a secure channel. This conversation is called the TLS handshake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStep 1: The client will send a “hello” message to the server, containing the TLS/SSL versions it is using, a list of supported cipher suites, and string of random bytes (called the \u003cem\u003eclient random\u003c/em\u003e).\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is meant by “cipher suite?” We’ll get to that. First of all, a cipher is simply an algorithm to encrypt a message. For example, replacing each letter in a message with a number is a type of cipher. But the ones used by TLS are far more complicated and impossible to break by humans or computers alike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cipher can be \u003cem\u003esymmetric\u003c/em\u003e or \u003cem\u003easymmetric\u003c/em\u003e. A symmetric cipher is one in which a single key is used to encrypt and decrypt the message. They are most useful when only you want to see the contents of the message, since sharing the key is a security risk. The most common symmetric cipher used by TLS is \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard\"\u003eAES (Advanced Encryption Standard)\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsymmetric ciphers require separate keys to encrypt and decrypt the message, and they are the most important component when establishing a secure session. What makes these algorithms work is that an attacker cannot decipher the message with the encryption key; he \u003cem\u003emust\u003c/em\u003e have the decryption key. Therefore, the encryption key, also called the Public Key, can be freely traded between parties without posing a security risk, as long as the decryption key (a.k.a. the Private Key) is not revealed.

Many common internet-facing applications secure data before it’s sent out into the world. But how? With an ingenious protocol known as TLS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhat is TLS?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the olden days of the internet, communication was completely unencrypted. This meant that eavesdroppers could potentially see all of the data sent over the internet. People had to be very careful when sending sensitive information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis problem was recognized as early as 1994, so the SSL (Secure Socket Layer) protocol was developed. SSL encrypts data at one endpoint and decrypts it at the other, such that data passed between computers was completely unintelligible. Keep in mind that this protocol does not protect data sitting on your computer (“at rest”); it only protects data in transit when two computers connect to each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTLS (Transport Layer Security) is a similar protocol to SSL and shares the same purpose. The first version was developed in 1999 and based on SSL 3.0. When SSL 3.0 was found to be insecure, it was completely replaced by TLS. TLS is used for web browsing, but can be used for a variety of services. Today, TLS 1.3 is the latest version of TLS and earlier versions should be avoided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou may have noticed when browsing the web that some URLs start with “http” and others with “https.” HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, and it is the protocol that retrieves HTML and other media to be displayed by your web browser. HTTPS is a version of HTTP with integrated TLS/SSL. In other words, accessing an “https” website means that your communications with the server are encrypted. It’s recommended that every website switch to HTTPS by purchasing an SSL certificate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eHow Does TLS Work\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first question one might ask about encrypted communication is “how do both parties know how to decrypt the messages? Surely they can’t just send the key over the web!” In fact, they can, and we will explain how step by step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuppose you are a web browser and you want to connect to a website’s host. The browser will conduct a conversation with the server to establish a secure channel. This conversation is called the TLS handshake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStep 1: The client will send a “hello” message to the server, containing the TLS/SSL versions it is using, a list of supported cipher suites, and string of random bytes (called the \u003cem\u003eclient random\u003c/em\u003e).\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is meant by “cipher suite?” We’ll get to that. First of all, a cipher is simply an algorithm to encrypt a message. For example, replacing each letter in a message with a number is a type of cipher. But the ones used by TLS are far more complicated and impossible to break by humans or computers alike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cipher can be \u003cem\u003esymmetric\u003c/em\u003e or \u003cem\u003easymmetric\u003c/em\u003e. A symmetric cipher is one in which a single key is used to encrypt and decrypt the message. They are most useful when only you want to see the contents of the message, since sharing the key is a security risk. The most common symmetric cipher used by TLS is \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard\"\u003eAES (Advanced Encryption Standard)\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsymmetric ciphers require separate keys to encrypt and decrypt the message, and they are the most important component when establishing a secure session. What makes these algorithms work is that an attacker cannot decipher the message with the encryption key; he \u003cem\u003emust\u003c/em\u003e have the decryption key.
